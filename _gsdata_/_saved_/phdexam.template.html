                                  <big>One of the most common questions
                                    that I am asked is how to get
                                    admitted to the PhD program at one
                                    of the IITs or other premier
                                    institutes. I often do not have an
                                    answer because the answer is very
                                    subjective. Different IITs have
                                    different admission criteria, which
                                    keep evolving over time. Even in my
                                    department (computer science, IIT
                                    Delhi) every year we try to improve
                                    the system, which has an effect on
                                    the duration and the formats of the
                                    exam. Instead of answering this
                                    question, let me try to answer this
                                    question indirectly by saying what I
                                    would have done if I were to apply
                                    to any of the IITs for a PhD. <br>
                                    <br>
Let me start with a disclaimer. The
content that I am writing in this
article exclusively represents my personal views. It does not represent nor claim to 
represent the views of the computer science department at IIT Delhi, or of IIT Delhi
in general. Neither am I claiming that by reading this article your chances of getting through
a PhD interview increase. I am simply putting my views forward from my perspective. <br>

Let us now look at a PhD in some more detail. It is widely considered the last and highest degree in a
student's educational journey. Some places have an additional degree called DSc; however, this is more of
an exception than a norm. Clearly, a PhD is like the top of the pyramind -- the apex. As I have argued
some of my other articles, PhD is also a license to teach, conduct research, and engage in high end R&D
activities. Secondly, it is unlike any other degree. Other degrees are time based and a student needs to
clear a minimum number of credits to obtain a degree. However, a PhD requires the student to create something
new, innovative, and technically substantive. The program is not time bound, and it is not even guaranteed
that all the candidates entering the PhD program will leave the program with a degree! The take home point
here is that PhD is an advanced degree, and thus an interview for admission to a PhD program will also
be difficult. <br>

Let me try to quantify this difficulty. Most IITs publicly release their shortlisting criteria months before
the application deadline. The shortlisting criteria specify a minimum GPA (or percentage) requirement. These
criteria often filter out a large number of potential candidates. Subsequently, there is an interview process,
which itself might have multiple stages. The first stage is typically a written exam, where the candidate
needs to answer a couple of questions (both objective and subjective). There might be additional written rounds
also. Subsequently, there are a couple of oral exams, where the candidate is evaluated by a committee of faculty
members. The first round might consist of a smaller committee of maybe 3-4 faculty members. In IIT Delhi
the last round consists of an interview by a committee that consists of all the faculty members in the department
(typically 20-30). As a result the acceptance rates are not very high in most premier institutes (1/30 to 1/60 to the
best of my knowledge). Let us try to dissect the reasons for having such an interview process, which is a standard
practice followed almost all over the world, and try to understand the deeper meaning. <br>

Let us consider another area such as music. `
