                                        M.Tech? </b><br>
                                      A)&nbsp; There are two methods. If
                                      you are an IIT student, then after
                                      the first semester in your
                                      M.Tech/MS program, you can apply
                                      for conversion. If you have a CGPA
                                      that is more than 8.0, the DRC
                                      (departmental research committee)
                                      can then consider your request and
                                      admit you after following due
                                      procedure. Otherwise, you can
                                      apply for the program after you
                                      complete your M.Tech/MS degree as
                                      a regular applicant. For IIT
                                      students, conversion is a good
                                      idea because this saves time.
                                      Otherwise, the work done for an
                                      M.Tech thesis will go waste. It
                                      cannot be a part of the Ph.D
                                      thesis. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Q) Can I apply if I just have a
                                        B.Tech?</b><br>
                                      A) Sure, you can. We in fact
                                      receive a lot of applications from
                                      B.Tech students. Please see the
                                      brochure from our PG section. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Q) I have a 15 lakh rupee job,
                                        why should I do a Ph.D? </b><br>
                                      A)&nbsp; First, the <u>philosophical


                                        answer</u>: A Ph.D is done for
                                      the love of research, for creating
                                      more knowledge, and for creating
                                      something new, money should not
                                      always be a factor. <br>
                                      A slightly more <u>practical
                                        answer</u>: Why did you enroll
                                      for a 4 year B.Tech and not do a 3
                                      year B.Sc?&nbsp; Clearly because
                                      you thought that the job prospects
                                      are better after a B.Tech. It is
                                      true that a B.Tech takes one more
                                      year to finish but the gains in
                                      the long run outweigh the losses
                                      during that extra year.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      The same logic holds for every
                                      additional degree. A person goes
                                      for an M.Tech to get a better job,
                                      which is more superior to the job
                                      that she was getting after a
                                      B.Tech in terms of pay, perks, job
                                      security, and future prospects. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      Now, if you need more
                                      (pay+perks+job
                                      security+prospects), join a Ph.D
                                      program. In today's market a Ph.D
                                      salary is significantly more than
                                      a B.Tech or M.Tech salary. It can
                                      easily be to the tune of 10 lakhs
                                      more than what is offered after
                                      B.Tech (if note more in some
                                      cases). Along with the salary
                                      there are additional advantages of
                                      job security, flexibility, and
                                      social respect. If you want you
                                      can join many other professions
                                      that are closed for non-Ph.Ds such
                                      as academic institutions, and
                                      research labs. The additional time
                                      and effort is correlated with
                                      material gains. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Q) Nobody in my family has done
                                        a Ph.D. They are wary about it
                                        and are worried about the
                                        interim. Especially, the few more
                                        years with little money.</b><br>
                                      <br>
                                      A) That is a fair point.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      Well, India is changing, and is
                                      changing very rapidly. I am pretty
                                      sure that very few in your family
                                      are doing a job in an MNC, but you
                                      are still joining or thinking of
                                      joining an MNC, without
                                      understanding the dynamics of a
                                      purely capitalist system all that
                                      well. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      The fact that if you know more,
                                      can do more, then you deserve to
                                      be paid more, is a matter of
                                      common sense. Clearly doing a Ph.D
                                      to know more and to learn more
                                      involves time and effort. However,
                                      there are benefits. Also a Ph.D is
                                      not that much of a sacrifice as it
                                      is made out to be.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      Consider the medical profession. A
                                      doctor with an MBBS can start her
                                      career at 24 after 5 years of
                                      study, and 1 year of internship.
                                      However, a lot of doctors prefer
                                      to go for super specialization.
                                      They need to do an MD for 2 more
                                      years, and an internship of 1 more
                                      year. This is again not enough to
                                      be a nephrologist, for example.
                                      Doctors need to study for a few
                                      more years, get enough work
                                      experience, and then start their
                                      own practice. One of my relatives
                                      who is now a top nephrologist in
                                      Mumbai started his career when he
                                      was about 35. It is true that now
                                      he is established and spends his
                                      holidays in Europe. But, you also
                                      need to factor in the long years
                                      of hard work, the long hours of
                                      working with patients in the dead
                                      of the night, with very little
                                      earnings. <br>

                                      If it is perfectly wise for a
                                      doctor to start his or her career
                                      in his early thirties, why is
                                      doing a Ph.D for an additional 5
                                      to 6 years after B.Tech
                                      unjustified? You will become a
                                      similar super-specialist and then
                                      make up for your years of hard
                                      work with little money like

                                        the time a Ph.D graduates her

                                        would have risen. Does your
                                        argument still hold water? </b><br>
                                      <br>
                                      A) This is correct. But, the fact
                                      that the instantaneous salary
                                      after let's say 3 years of an
                                      M.Tech will be more than the
                                      starting salary of a Ph.D is
                                      somewhat unlikely. Again,
                                      exceptions are possible and it is
                                      always possible that a student has
                                      a stellar performance in his or
                                      her job and gets fat pay raises
                                      and bonuses. With the same
                                      argument, it is also possible that
                                      a student has a stellar
                                      performance in her Ph.D and then
                                      is invited to a very prestigious
                                      foreign university to spend some
                                      time after her Ph.D, or gets a job
                                      with a very high pay package after
                                      her Ph.D. The general trend is
                                      that our Ph.D students have gotten
                                      good jobs in the past, and have
                                      been more than justifiably

                                      expected that if X students get a
                                      B.Tech degree, Y students get an

                                      I have just one point regarding
                                      the word ``settled'' that you will
                                      only hear in India and possibly in
                                      other south east Asian countries.
                                      This is an artifact of some
                                      colonial systems and the Nehruvian
                                      era where jobs were from the
                                      cradle to the grave. If a young
                                      man joined the civil services or
                                      the state electricity board at the
                                      age of 20, continuing till 60 was
                                      his inalienable right. He could
                                      not be dismissed on grounds of
                                      performance, discipline, or any
                                      other possible misdemeanor. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      That is not the reality of today's
                                      capitalist India. Nobody is really
                                      ``settled''. Most of my students
                                      change their jobs every few years
                                      like all of their peers. For a
                                      variety of reasons people find
                                      themselves to be in a variety of
                                      companies every few years spanning
                                      across different cities,
                                      countries, and even continents. A
                                      lot of my friends are now in
                                      startups and have invested a large
                                      amount of their savings in them.
                                      In today's day and age nobody is
                                      really ``settled'' in the
                                      traditional sense. Everybody is
                                      subject to the vagaries of the
                                      market. It is important to
                                      realize, ``jobs come and go'',
                                      ``degrees are forever''.&nbsp; <br>

                                      A) Think of a Ph.D as a regular
                                      job. A Ph.D, a job, pursuing a
                                      degree, are an aspect of an
                                      individual's professional life. A
                                      relationship, a wedding, a child,
                                      are a part of an individual's
                                      personal life. Let us think of
                                      them as <b>separate</b>. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      Every person in any profession
                                      needs to keep these aspects of
                                      life separate. A Ph.D is no
                                      different. A Ph.D in no way
                                      precludes any person -- male or
                                      female -- from getting married and
                                      starting a family. There is no
                                      reason, why a female student
                                      should think of Ph.D and marriage
                                      as mutually exclusive. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      In fact, as compared to a regular
                                      job, students have much more
                                      flexibility in a Ph.D program.
                                      Flexi-timings, work-from-home, and
                                      remote workplaces are novel
                                      concepts that have recently
                                      entered the jargon of our
                                      multinational companies. They are
                                      being advertised as the next in
                                      thing by their respective HR
                                      departments. These have been
                                      present in academia for a long
                                      time. Ph.D programs are extremely
                                      flexible and the advisor and
                                      advisee can decide all the
                                      specifics. Especially, in our
                                      computer science department where
                                      it is not necessary for a student
                                      to do experiments in a specific
                                      lab, dedicated lab time is not
                                      necessary. For example, I would
                                      not mind if a student works from
                                      home and shows up once a week or
                                      once a month. The final output
                                      matters, not whether it is created
                                      in the lab or at home, or in a
                                      coffee shop. <br>

                                      would leave my job, and search for
                                      a new one. This is easier said
                                      than done. There is no guarantee
                                      that you will get a job of the
                                      same quality in the new city or
                                      new country. In the new country,
                                      you might not have the necessary
                                      employment permits, and it might
                                      take several months to a year to
                                      get the necessary paper work done.

                                      In a lot of cases, employees
                                      typically negotiate with their
                                      current company and work from home
                                      for sometime, or go for some other
                                      flexible work package till they
                                      find a new job with comparable
                                      prospects. They might even
                                      continue their old job in their
                                      current location till they have
                                      the necessary paper work. <br>

                                      The same can be done in a Ph.D
                                      also. Moreover, IIT has rules to
                                      convert a full time Ph.D to part
                                      time. It is possible to take 2
                                      semesters off and pursue
                                      internships and other professional
                                      interests. Along with that, the
                                      adviser, advisee, and the
                                      department can work out different
                                      arrangements based on their mutual
                                      convenience. <br>

                                      A) Well, you are the best judge on
                                      what is the right choice for you.
                                      Note that it is possible to get an
                                      additional top-up of 10,000 Rs per
                                      month from your advisor's project
                                      funds and it is possible to spend
                                      up to two semesters in industrial
                                      internships where the pay packages
                                      are much higher. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      Our Ph.D stipends are much higher
                                      these days. Ph.D students get
                                      28,000 Rs. per month. If you add
                                      the additional 10,000 Rs topup, a
                                      student gets 38,000 Rs. per month
                                      (totally tax free). If you factor
                                      in super-subsidized accommodation
                                      and food (total: 4,000 per month)
                                      the situation is not that
                                      bad.&nbsp; <br>

                                      <br>
                                      A) If a team of experts from the
                                      department are selecting you, then
                                      it means that in all likelihood
                                      you have the potential to complete
                                      a Ph.D. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      As you rightly think, it is always
                                      possible that a student does not
                                      do well. She might not get the
                                      required GPA in courses, or might
                                      not be able to do research. If the
                                      latter is the course, the
                                      department offers the flexibility
                                      to the student to change topics
                                      and advisers. In spite of that if
                                      things are not working out, then
                                      the student always has an option
                                      for opting for the easier M.S.
                                      degree. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      A similar thing can happen in a
                                      regular job also. An employee
                                      might lose his or her drive,
                                      perform inconsistently, and face
                                      termination. However, in IIT Delhi
                                      we have both formal and informal
                                      counseling services, where a
                                      serious effort is made to keep a
                                      student on track. There are
                                      regular evaluations by dedicated
                                      research committees who suggest
                                      corrections during the tenure of
                                      the Ph.D program. <br>
                                      <br>

                                        about a Ph.D. What if my adviser

                                        does not allow me to graduate? </b><br>
                                      <br>
                                      A) These are just ``stories''. We
                                      want our students to graduate
                                      quickly. According to the
                                      institute all students are
                                      expected to graduate within 5
                                      years. Beyond 5 years, they do not
                                      get an institute assistantship and
                                      their hostel room is taken away.
                                      It is true that they are given 2
                                      additional years to complete their
                                      degree; however, this is meant to
                                      be the exception and not the norm.
                                      Students should set a target of 4
                                      years, which is reasonable in my
                                      opinion. Some students might want
                                      to graduate sooner, and it is
                                      often possible depending on the
                                      outcome of the research. A lot of
                                      our students have made it in 3 and
                                      3.5 years as well. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      &nbsp;Secondly, advisers are not
                                      the final authorities in a Ph.D
                                      program. It is the SRC (student
                                      research committee). If a student
                                      has any issue, she can always take
                                      it to the SRC, or to the head of
                                      the department. In IIT's system,
                                      an adviser can give all her inputs
                                      on creativity and the direction of
                                      research. However, he or she needs
                                      to play by the rules. There are
                                      sufficient checks and balances in
                                      the system to ensure that students
                                      are not unnecessarily victimized.

                                      previous question, if we are

                                      likelihood you are smart enough.
                                      The rest depends on your
                                      sincerity, your desire to work
                                      hard, your curiosity, creativity

                                      Trust me, a Ph.D is more about
                                      being sincere, systematic, and
                                      hard working rather than being

                                      give an example, one of my seniors
                                      joined a business consulting firm,
                                      Mckinsey, and worked with them for
                                      3-4 years. Then he opened his own
                                      company, which was later on bought
                                      by Google. <br>

                                      Universities and research labs are
                                      traditional employers of Ph.Ds.
                                      They are however NOT the only
                                      employers of Ph.Ds. You can join
                                      regular industries as members of

                                        want to stay in IIT's hostels. I
                                        don't like the food.</b><br>
                                      <br>
                                      A) That is a relevant point. We
                                      have very good housing options for
                                      married students. However, the
                                      wait time is currently about one
                                      and half years. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      Here, is an idea that I would like
                                      to encourage. A student can
                                      roughly get around 38K rupees (28K
                                      stipend + 10K topup) totally tax
                                      free. If let's say 3 students
                                      decide to stay off campus, they
                                      can easily do that. They will have
                                      a combined take home income of
                                      114K. They can easily pay a third
                                      of it as rent. The additional
                                      expenditure for food and a cook in
                                      the south Delhi area should not be
                                      more than 10K. They can thus enjoy
                                      a much superior quality of living
                                      and have food of their choice.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      It is true that most students do
                                      not explore this option, because
                                      they prefer hostel accommodation
                                      to be more convenient given the
                                      proximity. However, this is a
                                      matter of individual choice. It is
                                      by no means necessary to stay in a
                                      hostel. When we were graduate
                                      students abroad, all of us stayed
                                      in off-campus apartments and
                                      cooked our own food, and washed
                                      our own dishes and clothes.
                                      Thankfully, in India these
                                      services can be purchased without
                                      spending a lot of money. In fact,
                                      students in a lot of engineering
                                      colleges across the country also
                                      stay in rented accommodation with
