                  </h2>
                  <br />
In this article, I will talk about the seven stages of a
Ph.D, and the typical duration of a Ph.D. Let me start this discussion
by saying that no two Ph.D programs are
alike. The nature of the Ph.D program depends on the career aspirations
of the student. Students who aspire to join academia might want to go
more into exploratory research, whereas students with industry in mind
might want to focus more on practical aspects. Here are a set of
possible options:<br />
                  <ol><li>Fresh out of B.Tech directly joining the Ph.D
program</li><li>Student is joining Ph.D after a Master's
(M.Tech or M.S)</li><li>Part time student</li><li>Student is on leave from an academic institution</li><li>International student</li></ol>
It would be prudent to believe that students in these five categories
will have radically different career aspirations. Consequently, their
expectations from the Ph.D program will be different. <br />
Let us now break a typical Ph.D program into several phases, and see
where it needs to diverge for different students having different
expectations. <br />
Here are the different stages of a typical Ph.D program. <br />
                  <ol><li>Relevant course work</li><li>Skill development</li><li>Study of relevant technical literature</li><li>Participation in a project led by a senior
student</li><li>Research effort : prototyping ideas + writing
papers<br />
                    </li><li>Mentoring junior students<br />
                    </li><li>Helping the professor in formalizing future
research directions</li></ol>
These seven stages are supposed to take a student from a novice level
to the highest level of academic attainment, i.e., guiding others to
perform world class research. We can divide them into broadly three
stages namely Education (1 - 4), Research (5), Leadership (6-7). The
most interesting part is that research is just one stage out of seven
in a typical Ph.D program. This might come as&nbsp; a surprise to many;
however, this is fortunately or unfortunately true. On a better note,
this division into stages, does not mean that time is equally divided
across the stages. In fact, it is possible to pursue a set of above
mentioned goals simultaneously. The research component might be 99% of
the entire Ph.D effort, or might be even be as low as 30%. This is
dependent on how long the previous stages take. Secondly, all the
stages are not compulsory for everybody. It is theoretically possible
to directly jump to writing research papers (Stage 5) and leave out
everything else subject to institute rules. Let us now look into the
stages in some more detail. <br />
                  <br />
                  <em><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">[1-3]
Courses, Skills, Literature Survey</span></big></em><br />
Please refer to the figure in the <a href="phd_true_meaning.html">link</a>,
which shows that a Ph.D is a very humble and modest effort in extending
the state of the art. The objective is to create something, which is
completely new, technically sound, and desirably world class. To
propose something that has never been proposed before, a student needs
to be able to understand extremely complicated research papers, figure
out problems in them, and look at ways to solve them. Achieving all of
this, requires a very good knowledge of fundamentals as well as
superlative language skills. If a student is extremely good technically
but lacks the knowledge of English that is required to understand a
research paper, then he will not be able to conduct research
fruitfully. A building is only as strong as its foundation. The
foundation is never visible, but it holds the building together, and is
often blamed for catastrophic failures. <br />
In the US, kids typically write fairly complex software in school like
small computer games. They move on to fairly complicated software like
iPod or Android apps in college. These are also very decent means of
making money. Secondly, since English is their mother tongue, they
don't face any language issues. Unfortunately, we don't have these
advantages in India. Hence, it becomes essential to invest on
programming skills and linguistic skills before we undertake any
project. <br />
We should understand that one very important goal of Ph.D is getting a
much better job. This basic education takes us a long way towards that
goal. After the end of this goal, we would expect a student to be a
fairly proficient programmer. He should be able to undertake fairly
complicated tasks like modifying the linux kernel, or the gcc compiler
without a lot of difficulty. Secondly, he also should have developed a
good knowledge of the relevant literature in the area. Lastly, his
language skills should have developed to a point where he can write a
piece of text that can be appreciated by an international audience. <br />
In American universities, there is an exam called the "Ph.D qualifier"
that checks for all of these skills. Students are denied admission to
the Ph.D program if they fail to pass this test. In India the qualifer
is not that strict. My philosophy is that students can and should be
coached to reach the desired level. It is very essential to ensure that
a student meets all the quality standards before he can embark on
research; otherwise, research will be a very frustrating endeavor. <br />
                  <br />
                  <em><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">[4] Working
with a Senior Student<br />
                  </span></big></em>A typical question that comes to a
student's mind is
: if my Professor gives me something to solve, how do I solve it? How
is research done? This is a skill that takes some time to develop.
There is no reason to rush on this, or show haste. With time and
perseverance, anybody can become a great researcher. <br />
One quick way to learn how to do research is to work with a senior
student, who is already doing a lot of research. Younger students can
learn a lot of hands on tricks, short cuts, and useful trivia from a
senior student. Senior students typically make the best mentors and
guides for newcomers.<br />
                  <br />
                  <em><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">[5]
Performing Research</span></big></em><br />
Now, here comes the real meat of the Ph.D. Once a
student is well trained, and has the relevant experience, it is time
for him to start working on his Ph.D research. To reach this phase, it
might take anywhere from 3 months to 3 years. It depends upon the
student's background, and his desire to learn. It is my firm belief
that if a student is desirous to learn and work hard, he should be able
to overcome all kinds of obstacles, and quickly become world class. <br />
The most popular myth about a Ph.D is the phrase "<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Ph.D problem</span>". In a
Ph.D, the main problem is the supervisor <img style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" alt="wink" src="images/smiley_wink.png" />, who keeps on urging students to work.
The rest is easy. <br />
There is more about my model of research in this <a href="model.html">site</a>.
To summarize, I will start out by trying to align my interests with the
student's interest. Once a match is found, we will quickly finish a
survey of some related work, and review some of the areas and problems
that I have been working on. Most of these problems will typically also
have a corporate sponsor. The student is expected to keep them aware of
his research. This will ensure that his research is relevant, and he
can get good internships(preferably overseas), and job opportunities in
the future. <br />
Once the student choses an area to work on, we will get together and
have intensive meetings to find out shortcomings of previous work, and
where we can contribute. This will be the most intensive part of the
Ph.D. After having discussions, the student will begin the task of
implementing the research idea. This will take around 3 to 9 months.
Once, we get some good results, we will summarize them in a research
paper and send it to an international conference or a journal. It will
take some time for the paper to get accepted. It is typically necessary
to iteratively refine the work. Finally, the research paper should get
into a reputable conference/journal. I would ideally prefer that the
student travel overseas to present the paper in a conference as
frequently as possible. Please note that this is contingent on the
availability of funds. A Ph.D will typically have two or three papers
worth of work. <br />
During the course of the Ph.D, it is prudent to expect the student to
become more and more independent. Towards the end of this stage, he
should be able to find out problems of his own, and work on solutions.<br />
                  <em><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">[6-7]
Mentoring Stage - new research directions<br />
                  </span></big></em>&nbsp;Once a student has finished
about three fourths
of his Ph.D work, it is time for him to achieve a bigger role. He needs
to be given the opportunity to lead others. This is very important for
two reasons. Firstly, if he wishes to join academia, then he is getting
an opportunity to mentor students. If he wants to join industry, then
he can show this experience to get directly hired as a team lead or
manager. It also greatly broadens his scope and challenges him to do
even more innovative work. <br />
I would also expect students to take a look at real world research
proposals that are submitted to government bodies and other funding
agencies. He can also participate in them, and also work closely with
corporate sponsors to learn more about their work. This will prepare
him to take on important roles after graduation. <br />

                  <a name="howlong" class="clean-link"> How long
will a Ph.D take? </a> <br /> </big> </em>
                  This is
needless to say the most important question
in the mind of a student. A lot of people scoff at the idea of a Ph.D
because of the time commitment. I want to assure you that if you are
the Ph.D type, then this time is well spent. Nonetheless, let us try to
answer this question. <br />
An accurate answer to this question is - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whenever you will be able to
convince the Ph.D committee that you are ready to graduate</span>.
The Ph.D committee typically consists of other faculty members in the
department, an external Indian reviewer, and an external foreign
reviewer. Whenever, we are sure that all of them will approve the
thesis, the student can graduate if he wishes to.<br />
The next question is : When will these people approve a thesis? This
needs to be answered by taking a look at all the students who have
graduated in the past. Once a student's contribution is roughly the
same as the previous students, he should be confident to get through.<br />
Ph.D programs typically take about four to six years, depending upon
the performance of the student, and his desire to graduate. If the
student is a low performer, then he will take longer. Sometimes high
performing students desire to graduate sooner because they might have
family commitments, and need to settle down soon. Surprisingly, many a
time it does happen that students decide to stay a year or two longer
to strengthen their resume, such that they can get a better job.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I
am fine with all of these configurations, as long as the student's
thesis is worthy of getting approval from the Ph.D committee. </span><br />
