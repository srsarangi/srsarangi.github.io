                  <div>
                  <p>This
is a very common question that students, and their guardians ask us.
Unfortunately in India, this question is a subset of a larger family of
questions. All the questions are of the same format:</p>
                  <p><big><big>Should I go to US/Europe for *** ?</big></big><br />
                  <br />
Here, *** can be anything starting from high school to undergraduate
education to a vacation to even designer shoes. This is just dependent
on the amount of money a person has. Traditionally, using imported
materials has been a status symbol.&nbsp; Even in the US, people make
it a point to inform their guests that they have used Italian marble,
fixtures from Belgium, and upholstery from Turkey. I am pretty sure
that in Italy, Belgium, or Turkey, people pride themselves about goods
from some other countries. This points to a basic feature of human
psychology, i.e. every oddity is a style. Something that is foreign,
obscure, and in some manner sounds remote, is reflective of opulence. <br />
                  <br />
Let us take the case of tanning salons in the US. A tanning salon has a
set of ultraviolet incubators. People stay in them for half an hour to
one hour, and come out with darker skin. This is also referred to as
"tanned skin". It is considered very fashionable in the US to show off
one's skin tan. The expensive way to achieve a tan is to go on a
vacation to the Carribean. Because of time and monetary constraints, a
cheap and small-town way to achieve the same is to go to a tanning
salon. <br />
An American friend once jokingly told me that in any town in America,
you will find three things: McDonalds, Walmart, and a tanning salon.
This is probably true, or very close to the truth. The interesting
thing to note here is that since Americans have fair skin, they
consider tanned skin fashionable. In India, we have the reverse
situation. Since we have a dark skin, people crave for fairer skin.
This explains the popularity of fairness creams in the market. Here
again, we see that for every culture, grass on the other side is
greener.<br />
                  <br />
Leaving luxury apart, let us take the case in which using imported
commodities or services actually makes a tangible difference other than
mere perception. One sector is definitely education, and the other is
healthcare. We cannot compromise on quality in both of these sectors. <br />
                  <br />
Let us consider medical treatment first. One of my friends in Malaysia,
once told me that he had to go to Singapore for an appendicitis
operation. Fortunately, in India we don't need to go to Singapore for
an appendicitis operation. The reason for this is that the technology
for such operations is very well established in India. An overwhelming
majority of the operations<br />
are successful. Even if there is a complication, it happens only for a
vanishingly small number of cases. We can say the same for a large
number of medical procedures. Secondly, every year more and more
procedures are getting added to the list. In fact in some areas like
stem cell therapy, or heart surgeries, India is a world leader. This
explains why medical tourism has become so popular in India. Patients
from the US, UK don't just come to India because of cheaper treatment.
They are also finding a value for money, and world class care. <br />
                  <br />
However, we can't make a sweeping statement for all areas of medicine.
A lot of&nbsp; advanced medical procedures especially related to organ
transplants, and brain surgeries, are still not performed in India, or
are not at an acceptable level. In this case, it makes sense to go
abroad. <br />
                  <br />
We observe that there is a line. Below the line, it makes absolutely no
sense&nbsp; to go abroad. Imagine a person going to the US just to
treat a minor flu. Not only is this a bad idea, it is also not
advisable from a medical point of view.&nbsp; The person is avoiding
rest, subjecting himself to the strain of a long flight, and not
gaining anything in the process. Secondly, in India there are friends
and relatives who can provide some support. Doctors are well aware of
viruses prevalent in India, and can provide much better treatment. I
know of at least two tragic cases in which doctors in the US could not
diagnose cerebral malaria. This wouldn't have been the case, if the
patients would have been treated in India. <br />
                  <br />
If a disease is on the line, then of course it depends on the amount of
money a patient has. And, if the disease is above the line, then a
patient should go abroad, and get himself or herself appropriately
treated if he or she can afford it. We need to note that every year
this line is going up. Ten years ago, patients use to go abroad for
heart bypass surgeries. Now, doing so is not considered a very wise
decision. It is advisable to get it done locally.<br />
                  <br />
We have a similar situation in the case of higher education. Students
need to first know where the line is. Secondly, they should try to
evaluate if they are above the line or below the line. If a student is
extremely exceptional and feels that faculty members in India cannot do
justice to his or her talent, then he or she should definitely seek
opportunities abroad. Alternatively, if a student is interested in an
area, which is not well represented in India, then also he or she
should look at getting trained in the US or Europe. We can classify
these cases to be above the line. <br />
                  <br />
However, if a student is well below the line, and desires to go abroad
just because it is fashionable, then there is a problem. It is similar
to seeking treatment for flu in the US. Not only will the quality of
treatment be similar or in most cases inferior, the additional
overheads will become prohibitive. We need to understand that when
somebody goes abroad to study, he or she should be prepared to
lead&nbsp; a very difficult life.<br />
                  <br />
First, the stipend that is offered is minimal. In fact it is a couple
of hundred dollars below the poverty line. For most Indian families,
parents are not in a position to financially help their children
studying abroad. Students have to adjust to an extremely frugal
lifestyle. Since there is no concept of a mess in most places, and
eating out is expensive, students need to cook most of their meals.
Along with cooking, students have to&nbsp; manage all other basic tasks
like washing clothes, ironing, and cleaning utensils all by their own
along with a very heavy amount of course work. We take all of these
services for granted in India. Secondly, the stipend is not enough to
afford good quality housing. Students are typically forced to share
rooms with one or two more students. Most of these houses have pretty
bad quality, and are often in unsafe neighborhoods.<br />
                  <br />
Along with the lack of financial support, the other issue is the
"culture shock". It is hard for most people to adjust to an alien
culture. The Indian academic system is characterized by a very good
amount of interaction between students and faculty members at the
personal level. This is not the case in the US. Relationships are&nbsp;
extremely formal. Students who have some special requirements feel left
out in such situations. Especially, in the US, the entire system is
based on the simple notion of "survival of the fittest". This makes the
life of students extremely stressful. It does ensure a lot of
productivity though, at a price. <br />
                  <br />
Given, the tenuous situation, most Indian students who go to the US in
the hope of doing a Ph.D, drop out after an M.S. Students who finish
their Ph.Ds are those who feel that their Ph.D degree will finally
outweigh all of this hardship. This is the case for students who are,
"above the line". Otherwise, students also realize that&nbsp; the
overheads of pursuing a Ph.D are prohibitive abroad, and drop out in
the middle. Given the fact that the difference between the west and the
east is increasingly narrowing, a degree from a mediocre institution in
the US or Europe for an <br />
otherwise good student has questionable value. A person will not do a
Ph.D again. Hence, he or she should be concerned about the brand value
of the institution that he or she seeks to study at. If a person does a
Ph.D from a top institute in India or China, then at least he can say
that he used the best available opportunity in his country. Secondly,
the prestige of these institutions is expected to increase with the
rising GDP of these countries. It is widely believed that degrees from
top institutes in developing countries like India or China will stand
the test of time.<br />
                  <br />
The obvious question that arises here is how do students find if they
are above or&nbsp; below the line. Overestimating oneself is basic
human nature. Left to themselves, most students will consider
themselves to be above the line, only to realize later in life that
their basic presumption was wrong. In this case, it is the duty of
academics and educators like myself to advise students appropriately
about the right choice of career. <br />
                  <br />
The first thing that academics need to do is publicize their research
such that students are aware of the nature of work being done in Indian
academia. Secondly, students in India also need to find out more about
the nature of work being done locally. In this regard, students need to
learn how to evaluate a list of publications. They should not go by the
number of publications. They should rather look at the prestige of the
conferences and journals at which the papers were published.<br />
It is possible to get the list of top conferences and journals in an area by just googling. <br />
                  <br />
Once students have identified faculty members who are doing in their
area of interest, they should initiate a process of dialogue, and find
out more about the requirements for doing research in their area of
choice. They should also look at the profiles of other students who
have pursued research with the Professor, and talk to them. After this
initial round of research, if students feel that their talents and
aspirations are way above what is available locally, and faculty
members also concur with the view, then the student should definitely
consider pursuing a higher degree from abroad. Not only is it a very
good thing for the student, it will also help academia and industry in
India bridge the skill gap. <br />
                  <br />
However, if this is not the case, then it is probably more advisable to
pursue higher studies locally, and make the best use of the
opportunity. It is definitely possible to do world class research in
India, and a lot of people are already doing it. We just need to expand
this community from hundreds to thousands. <br />
