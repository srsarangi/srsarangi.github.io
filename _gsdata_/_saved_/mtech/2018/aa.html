      <u>Shortlisting Criteria:</u> <a href="criteria.pdf">link</a>
      (The criteria is the same for MS and M.Tech)<br>
      IIT graduates with a CGPA &gt;= 8.0 have been shortlisted in the
      full time program, even if they<br>
      do not satisfy the GATE cutoff (see the information brochure). <br>
      <br>
      Please note that the department reserves the right to terminate
      the application process of<br>
      any candidate who has been erroneously shortlisted, or has
      provided incorrect information. <br>
      Also, at a later point of time the department can invite
      candidates who should have been shortlisted,<br>
      but for some reason their name does not appear in the list of
      shortlisted candidates.<br>
      If a candidate believes that she should have been shortlisted as
      per our shortlisting criteria<br>
      and her name does not appear in this list, then please let us know
      immediately. Our only<br>
      request is that prior to sending an e-mail please go over the
      shortlisting criteria several times. <br>
      <br>
      All the candidates should receive an e-mail from an authorized
      person at IIT Delhi<br>
      before the 10th of May. The e-mail will serve the purpose of a
      formal invitation letter for the interview<br>
      and will contain a link to this website. If you do not get the
      e-mail, please let the M.Tech co-ordinator<br>
      know immediately. <br>
      <br>
      <u>Direct Admissions:</u> A student who is offered a direct
      admission need not appear for the<br>
      interview. She can simply send her acceptance to the M.Tech
      co-ordinator directly. Please note <br>
      that we do not offer direct admissions to the MS program. The list
      of directly admitted<br>
      candidates can be found <a href="direct.pdf">here</a>. Please
      note that the last date for intimating the M.Tech<br>
      co-ordinator about your acceptance/rejection decision is: <b>17th
        May, 2017</b>. Please do not <br>
      hesitate to mail the co-ordinator if you have any other questions
      or clarifications.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Candiates Invited for the Interview:&nbsp; </u>For the the
      remaining candidates we will conduct<br>
      interviews on the 23rd and 24th of May. Please find a consolidated
      list of candidates to<br>
      be called for the interview over <a href="shortlisted.pdf">here</a>
      (includes part time candidates as well). Please note the following
      points:<br>
    </big>
    <ol>
      <li><big>There are a few candidates who have applied to both the
          M.Tech and MS(R) programs.<br>
          We will be conducting a single interview for both the
          programs. <br>
        </big></li>
      <li><big>If a student is selected for both the programs, M.Tech
          and MS(R), we will ask the student<br>
          to indicate their choice (during the interview).</big></li>
      <li><big>Please find your application number from the list of
          shortlisted candidates. Note that for<br>
          those students who have applied to both the M.Tech and MS(R)
          programs, they will see<br>
          only one of their applications in the list. Now, for the
          application that <u>shows up in our list</u>, note its<br>
          number. If it is an even number, your interview date is the
          24th of May, and if it is an odd<br>
          number your interview date is the 23rd of May. For example, if
          an application number is 2497, the<br>
          interview date is the 23rd of May. If the application number
          would have been 1406, the interview <br>
          date would have been the 24th of May. <font color="#ff0000">Only








            consider that application of yours that is mentioned in<br>
            our list. </font><br>
        </big></li>
      <li><big>If a candidate does not show up on their allotted
          interview date, we will terminate their <br>
          application process. <br>
        </big></li>
      <li><big>If due to some emergency, the candidate cannot make it on
          her allotted day, she can request <br>
          Ms. Rekha Rathee for appearing on the other day. For all such
          requests, there needs to be a<br>
          compelling reason. The subject of the e-mail should be:
          Interview date: &lt;app number, name&gt;<br>
        </big></li>
    </ol>
    <p><u><big>Day of the Interview</big></u>: <big><br>
      </big></p>
    <big>
      <ol>
        <li>&nbsp;Report to the CSE Department, Bharti Building, IIT
          Delhi, at 9:30 AM. Please proceed to room number<br>
          101.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>You need to bring the following documents:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Your original degree certificates and all your marksheets.</li>
          <li>GATE scorecard (full time, non-sponsored candidates only)</li>
          <li>Original IIT degree or IIT id-card (for IIT graduates with
            a CGPA &gt;= 8.0)</li>
          <li>Sponsorship/No-objection certificate from employer
            (sponsored/part time candidates only)</li>
          <li>OBC certificate and non-creamy layer certificate (OBC
            candidates only)</li>
          <li>SC/ST/PH certificate (SC/ST/PH candidates only)</li>
        </ol>
        <li>The interview is subject to the production of these
          certificates. You are also required to submit one set<br>
          of self attested copies of all the relevant documents at the
          time of the interview.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><u>Format of the Interview:</u><br>
      </p>
      <p>For non-sponsored full time candidates, the GATE score will
        have 70% weightage, and the interview will have 30% weightage.<br>
        The interview committee will typically have at least 2-3 faculty
        members from the computer science department.<br>
        They will ask you questions primarily in these 4 areas: basic
        mathematics (probability, transcendental functions),<br>
        basic computer science (data structures, binary numbers,...),
        data structures/algorithms, and computer systems<br>
        (OS + programming languages + architecture). Optionally, they
        might ask you questions from your area of choice<br>
        such as DBMS or Networks. You can leave after your interview.
        The results will be put up on our website at a later<br>
        date. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Note that the interview is a very technical exercise. You will
        be asked to solve challenging problems in the<br>
        4 aforementioned areas. Please come with adequate <b>preparation</b>.
        A good idea would be to go over all the material<br>
        taught in the first 2-3 years of a typical undergraduate course.
        You can also look at resources on the web for<br>
        sample questions and tutorials. <br>
