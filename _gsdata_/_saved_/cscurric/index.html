    <h3><font color="#ff0000">Important Disclaimer</font></h3>
    <font color="#ff0000">Prof. Smruti R. Sarangi (IIT Delhi) and Prof.
      Vikram Goyal (IIIT Delhi) had the privelege of chairing a
      committee to look into <br>
      the current CBSE Computer Science curriculum, and propose a new
      curriculum. This site contains the recommendations made by this<br>
      committee. Please note that this committee's role was limited to
      conducting independent research, and submitting a report<br>
      to CBSE. CBSE or any other organisation are not responsible for
      any errors<br>
      of omission or commission in any of the documents available on
      this site. The material on this site does not necessarily
      represent CBSE's<br>
      official views, neither does CBSE necessarily endorse all the
      contents/views in the documents put up on this site. Note that<br>
      this independent curriculum committee is responsible for the
      contents of this site, and CBSE or any other organisation
      including IIT Delhi<br>
      and IIIT Delhi do not bear any responsibility, and are not legally
      liable for the contents of this site. This site is meant to
      disseminate<br>
      academic material in national interest, which is based on easily

      administrative issues such as the official status of the proposed
      curriculum, modes of operationalisation and the examination <br>
      pattern, official communication from CBSE is the only authentic
      source. If anybody feels that there are errors on this site, or<br>
      in the linked documents, or they have any comments, then please
      mail the committee chairs. Please use the following e-mail id:</font><br>

    The committee acknowledges CBSE, in specific Ms. Anita Karwal
    (Chairperson, CBSE),&nbsp; for initiating this activity, and
    motivating<br>
    the committee members to work hard. The committee also is very
    grateful to Mr. Subhash Garg (Deputy Director, CBSE) for connecting<br>
    the members to school teachers and Principals in many different
    schools across the country. Please note that there are sections of
    the <br>
    curriculum document that have been copied verbatim from CBSE's
    existing curriculum documents. <br>

    <p><b><font color="#000099">Vision of the Committee</font></b><b>:&nbsp;










      </b>The vision of the committee is to recommend a curriculum that
      is modern, is relatively light, teaches<br>
      timeless concepts such as abstraction and computational thinking,
      is up to international standards, focuses on problem solving
      skills, <br>
      teaches students how to use computers to earn a better livelihood,
      and does justice to all students irrespective of their stream of
      study (Science, Commerce, <br>
      Humanities). The committee also envisions learning materials that
      are suitable for all children irrespective of background and
      disability. <br>
      Furthermore, the recommendation to CBSE is to ensure that the
      curricular documents are error-free, well written, and are <br>
      available at a very low cost (preferably free) to all students,
      particularly those who are economically backward.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><font color="#000099">Message to the Public: </font></b><br>
      1. There is nothing masculine about computer science. Girls can do
      computer programming as well as boys if not better. Please
      dissuade<br>
      yourself from believing and propagating in such baseless
      stereotypes, which have no scientific basis.<br>
      2. Please do not assume that a student who has shown learning
      deficits in other subjects, is automatically unsuitable for<br>
      computer science (CS). Sometimes the structured nature of CS
      subjects is good for students with special needs, particularly
      those with<br>
      autism. In the view of the committee the school should do
      everything possible to educate every student irrespective of
      disability, and if<br>
      there is a suspicion that a given student is not up to the mark
      because of a learning disability, adequate professional help
      should be taken,<br>
      before arriving at any conclusions.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b><font color="#000099">Methodology: </font></b><br>
      The committee worked for roughly 3 months. The members performed a
      comparative study of the curricula of roughly 15 countries, read
      research<br>
      papers on designing curricula for schools, studied the history of
      teaching computer science in the Indian school system, studied the
      ACM<br>
      K12 model curriculum, talked to scores of students, parents, and
      teachers, and contacted experts who specialize in teaching
      children<br>
      with special needs. The members concluded that a new curriculum is
      required because the focus needs to change to problem solving<br>
      rather than teaching the nuances of any given programming
      language, and secondly obsolete topics should be removed. The
      Informatics <br>
      Practices course should be redesigned because it could do better
      to capture the training requirements of students particularly in
      the Commerce<br>
      and Humanities streams. A focus on financial computing, analytics,
      and business processes in IT, was thus considered essential.<br>

    <br>
    <b><font color="#006600">Salient Features (of the recommendations)</font></b><br>
    <ol>
      <li>In classes 9 and 10, have one course called <i>Computer
          Applications</i>.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Introduce basic programming logic using an educational
          language called <font color="#ff0000">Scratch</font>, or
          Python (for special needs children).</li>
        <li>Focus on basic foundational skills and socially relevant
          projects. <br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>&nbsp;Modify the Computer Science (CS) course (in classes 11
        and 12) as follows:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Change the focus from learning a language to<u> learning <font
              color="#ff0000">logic</font></u><font color="#ff0000"> </font>and<font
            color="#006600"> <font color="#000099"><u>problem solving
                skills</u></font></font>.</li>
        <li>Teach Python (easy language with very rich features) instead
          of C++/Java. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Introduce latest technologies: 3G, 4G, cloud computers,
          NoSql databases, parallel programming.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Teach <font color="#000099">basic </font>computer science
          concepts: recursion, efficiency, and basic data structures.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>Upgrade the Informatics Practices (IP) course (in classes 11
        and 12)</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Specifically tailored towards students interested in
          business management, data analytics, and accounting.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Replace Java with Python</li>
        <li>Add a significant <i>Data Science</i> component that has
          explicit focus on data analysis, statistics, and
          visualization. <br>
          Decrease the focus on computer hardware, networking and other
          low level details. Again focus on <font color="#ff0000">logic
            for data analytics</font>.</li>
        <li>Introduce a small module on<i> software engineering</i> and
          <i>IT based</i> <i>business processes</i>. Learn how to draw
          business use-case<br>
          diagrams for IT enabled real-world businesses. <br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>Discontinue the course on Multimedia and Web Technology (in
        classes 11 and 12).</li>
      <li> Introduce the new curriculum for classes 9 and 11 in the
        academic year 2018-19. However, for the first year there should
        be an overlap <br>
        between the new and old curricula. Subsequently it is
        conter-productive. </li>
      <li>For all classes rigorously teach cyber safety, cyber
        etiquette, effects of digital technology on society and
        responsible use of social media.</li>
      <li>Do highly <font color="#cc0000">feature rich projects</font>,
        and preferably take problems from the neighbourhood. Do very
        socially relevant projects that somebody<br>
        finds useful. For IP students, focus on projects related to EMI
        calculation and financial prediction, accounting for small
        businesses, creating <br>
        GST invoices, and inventory management. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Follow the recommendations to make the curriculum friendly
        towards children with special needs. Lot of suggestions from
        experts in the area.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><font color="#000099">Version of Python: 3.x (3.0 and above)<br>
        Any platform is fine.</font><br>
