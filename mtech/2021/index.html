    1. The approved shortlisting criteria is posted at this <a
      href="shortlisting-criteria.pdf" moz-do-not-send="true">link</a>.
    Note that the department has the liberty to define shortlisting
    criteria over and above<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the minimum requirements of the institute.
    We will thus not entertain any communication in this regard. For
    regular full time candidates we need a <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CSE GATE score and a Bachelors degree in
    CSE, EE, or Maths.<br>
    <br>
    2. We have selected the following candidates who have a B.Tech
    degree from an IIT. They do not need a GATE score. Note that the
    list is tentative (subject to verification<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by our PG section).<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="1" width="300">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">S. No.<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">Name<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><br>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><br>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    3. For the rest of the candidates, we have put up the list of
    shortlisted candidates at this <a href="applications.xlsx">link</a>.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The list of full time candidates is sorted by
    the GATE score. Their selection will be via the GATE score only.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The selected IIT students are listed in the
    second tab.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. The third tab contains the list of part time
    and sponsored candidates. We will schedule their interviews sometime
    in July. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. This list is <b>tentative. </b>It is
    possible that some of the data that the students have supplied is
    incorrect. Before issuing an offer letter<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our PG section will
    thoroughly verify all this data. If an applicant is found to have
    supplied wrong data or is otherwise not eligible, then<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he/she will not be
    offered a seat.<br>
    <br>
    4. The <b>tentative </b>seat strength is as follows: 24 (GEN), 9
    (SC), 4 (ST), 16 (OBC), 6 (EWS). The seat allocation will be done as
    per GoI rules.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some of these seats will be offered to
    MS Research students.<br>
    <br>
    If you feel that there is any discrepancy in the data, kindly send
    an e-mail by the 25th of May, 5 PM to:<br>
