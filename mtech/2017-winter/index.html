        <u>Shortlisting Criteria:</u> <a
href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/%7Esrsarangi/mtech/2017-winter/criteria.pdf">link</a><br>
        IIT graduates with a CGPA &gt;= 8.0 have been shortlisted in the
        full time program, even if they<br>
        do not satisfy the GATE cutoff (see the information brochure). <br>
        <br>
        Please note that the department reserves the right to terminate
        the application process of<br>
        any candidate who has been erroneously shortlisted, or has
        provided incorrect information. <br>
        Also, at a later point of time the department can invite
        candidates who should have been shortlisted,<br>
        but for some reason their name does not appear in the list of
        shortlisted candidates.<br>
        If a candidate believes that she should have been shortlisted as
        per our shortlisted criteria<br>
        and her name does not appear in this list, then please let us
        know immediately. Our only<br>
        request is that prior to sending an e-mail please go over the
        shortlisting criteria several times. <br>
        <br>
        All the candidates should receive an e-mail from an authorized
        person at IIT Delhi<br>
        before the 1st of December. The e-mail will serve the purpose of
        a formal invitation letter for the interview<br>
        and will contain a link to this website. If you do not get the
        e-mail, please let the M.Tech co-ordinator<br>
        know immediately. <br>
        <br>
        <u>Candiates Invited for the Interview:&nbsp; </u>For the the
        remaining candidates we will conduct<br>
        interviews on the 4th and 5th of December, 2017. Please note the
        following points:</big></p>
    <p><u><big>Day of the Interview</big></u>: <big><br>
      </big></p>
    <big>
      <ol>
        <li>&nbsp;Report to the CSE Department, Bharti Building, IIT
          Delhi, at 9:30 AM. Please proceed to the CSE Office on the
          third floor.</li>
        <li>You need to bring the following documents:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Your original degree certificates and all your marksheets.</li>
          <li>GATE scorecard (full time, non-sponsored candidates only)</li>
          <li>Original IIT degree or IIT id-card (for IIT graduates with
            a CGPA &gt;= 8.0)</li>
          <li>Sponsorship/No-objection certificate from employer
            (sponsored/part time candidates only)</li>
          <li>OBC certificate and non-creamy layer certificate (OBC
            candidates only)</li>
          <li>SC/ST/PH certificate (SC/ST/PH candidates only)</li>
        </ol>
        <li>The interview is subject to the production of these
          certificates. You are also required to submit one set<br>
          of self attested copies of all the relevant documents at the
          time of the interview.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><u>Format of the Interview:</u><br>
      </p>
      <p>For non-sponsored full time candidates, the GATE score will
        have 70% weightage, and the interview will have 30% weightage.<br>
        The interview committee will typically have at least 2-3 faculty
        members from the computer science department.<br>
        They will ask you questions primarily in these 4 areas: basic
        mathematics (probability, transcendental functions),<br>
        basic computer science (data structures, binary numbers,...),
        data structures/algorithms, and computer systems<br>
        (OS + programming languages + architecture). Optionally, they
        might ask you questions from your area of choice<br>
        such as DBMS or Networks. You can leave after your interview.
        The results will be put up on our website at a later<br>
        date. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Note that the interview is a very technical exercise. You will
        be asked to solve challenging problems in the<br>
        4 aforementioned areas. Please come with adequate <b>preparation</b>.
        A good idea would be to go over all the material<br>
        taught in the first 2-3 years of a typical undergraduate course.
        You can also look at resources on the web for<br>
        sample questions and tutorials. <br>
