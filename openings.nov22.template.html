                  </h2>
                  <big>We are urgently looking to fill in three research project
positions. The projects are scheduled to begin by the end of this year.
We are looking for candidates who preferably have an M.Tech or
equivalent degree in computer science or electronics engineering, and
would like to pursue a research career. Good programming skills, strong
analytical skills, and knowledge of fundamentals in computer
architecture are necessary. Exceptional candidates with a B.Tech or
equivalent degree can also apply. <br />
                  <br />
In the first project, a candidate will be expected to work on a state
of the art architecture simulator and implement a couple of research ideas
 (see the flyer <a href="files/tejas_poster.pdf">here</a>). In the second project, the candidate
will be working on power and temperature management 
algorithms (see flyer <a href="files/position_lhc_1.pdf">here</a>). There
is a good possibility of getting research papers, and patents from
these projects. Secondly, it is possible for the candidate to simultaneously pursue a
higher degree in IIT. However, the candidate needs to go through the
relevant admission process, which has its own independent selection
procedure and publicly advertised shortlisting criteria.<br />
                  <br />
Please track this page to find a formal announcement along with
interview dates at a future point of time. In the meantime, you can
send <a href="contact_research.html">me</a> your resume. <br />

                  <h2> <a name="students" class="no-dec-color" > Students </a> </h2>
                  <big>I am currently looking for motivated Ph.D, M.Tech, and M.S students.
Ph.D and M.S research students are provided with excellent facilities in IIT Delhi. They include
hostel facilities, office space, computing facilities, and support for attending international 
conferences. They also get to engage in high end research, interact with reputed researchers from 
other universities, and even spend time at research labs, or foreign universities. Secondly, 
most Ph.D/M.S students publish papers in top international conferences and journals, and typically
have a successful career in high end R&D facilities, academia, or industrial research labs.
PLEASE NOTE: It is possible to be employed in a research project position, and simultaneously 
pursue a Ph.D or M.S (research).  <br />
<br />

Please see the <a href="projects.html"> projects </a> page for the details of some of the current projects
that we are involved in. Some of my students are currently focused on hybrid computer architectures, nano-scale interconnects, 
fault tolerance, and large scale parallel simulation. However, I am also open to any other idea in computer
architecture that students might be willing to pursue. If you are academically outstanding and want to pursue
a career in research or advanced R&D then please send <a href="contact_research.html">me </a> your resume.
