                  <h2 class="title">Career options after a ph.D</h2><br />
Let me first try to dispel the most commonly held myth, "Ph.D is a
training to become an university professor". This is not true. If a
professor graduates 5 phds in his lifetime, and if all of them get
employed in academia, then the size of academia needs to increase five
fold. However, this does not happen. The proportion of phds that join
academia is not very large, and is definitely not the most preferred
option or the last resort. <br />
                  <br />
Before delving into this issue further, we need to understand that a
Ph.D is just not a degree. It is the training that is valuable than the
actual "Dr." stamp itself. In a good Ph.D, it is exected that the
candidate would have engaged in state of the art research. He or she
would have understood deep research issues, and would have made a
modest effort to solve a few problems. Furthermore, he would be used to
putting long hours at work, solve extremely complicated problems, and
handle frustrating situations with ease. These skills are just not
required to be an academic, they are required in almost all other
disciplines such as industrial R&amp;D, finance, and public service. <br />
                  <br />
The addition of a Ph.D to a resume is two-fold: knowledge and skills.
Any job can utilize either of these to different degrees. Let us look
at the common career options. <br />
                  <br />
Traditionally, the most preferred jobs for Ph.Ds have been industrial
R&amp;D Labs, university positions, and start-ups. Industrial R&amp;D
facilities typically have large exclusive Ph.D-only groups. These
groups engage in research, design new products, and also take part in
long term strategy decisions. The average salary in an industrial
R&amp;D lab is much more than in pure development centers. In India,
research lab salaries are about 50% more. This means that a person with
a Ph.D joining a research lab at 27 years of age is significantly
better paid than his classmate with 5 years of experience after B.Tech.
                  <br />
                  <br />
Along with exclusive R&amp;D labs, a lot of development centers hire
Ph.Ds with more or less research lab salaries. They fit Ph.Ds in their
hirearchy by hiring them in relatively senior positions as compared to
their classmates who were hired directly after B.Tech. As per the
author's estimate, Ph.Ds get a headstart of about 5 to 10 years. This
has a significant bearing on the salary structure and the designation. <br />
                  <br />
Since the last ten years, the marriage between academia and start-ups
is becoming stronger and stronger. There is a lot of movement between
them in either direction. Secondly, start-ups have also become
formidable engines of innovation. Consequently, a lot of Ph.Ds join
start-ups directly, or join them after some years in academia.
Sometimes, Ph.Ds join the university system after working for 5 to 10
years in a startup. They&nbsp; bring in a lot of new ideas with them in
the process. <br />
                  <br />
Another interesting trend has emerged in the last fifteen years. A
disproportionate number of Ph.Ds in computer science are joining the
finance and business consulting industries. Some of the jobs that they
are hired for are analysts, consultants, and auditors. The finance
industry uses their superior analytic capabilities and compensates them
very well for the services that they render. <br />
                  <br />
Lastly, I should mention that academia has always been a favorite
choice of Ph.Ds primarily because of the freedom. Salaries in academia
in India have been rising steadily. Considering free accommodation, a
permanent job, and all other perks, the salaries are now fairly
competitive with industry. Secondly, it is also possible for Ph.Ds to
pursue academic job opportunities in other countries also. <br />
                  <br />
This list is by no means exhaustive. It is just meant to elucidate the
fact that a Ph.D is hired for his superior analytical skills, and for
his power to solve complex problems. He has the choice of doing
challenging jobs in his discipline or he can move other areas like
finance if he so desires. Furthermore, the prevailing salaries in India
and a large part of the western world are highly biased in favor of
phds.<br />
