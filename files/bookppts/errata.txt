1) Example 30:
	Should be cmp r1, r2
    Variable index should be removed

2) Algorithms 5 and 6 (page 351):
    In the forwarding conditions: not and mov instructions not taken care of

3) Division algorithm should be made clearer. We need to say that we are considering
n bit 2's complement numbers that can only be positive.

4) Memory system: Question 25, percentage of memory accesses missing, TLB insert time

5) Example 121: j --> jdx

6) Microprogramming: Implement a processor where the return address is passed via the stack.
We should not be adding 4 to the PC again the routine. We are already adding 4 to the PC
in the preamble. Example 104: We should <store> for memory operations other than <write>

7) Page 382: Inserting bubbles reduces the CPI --> should be increasing

8) Figure 7.18 : W <-- P_B (statement is not required and is redundant)

9) Page 315, The call instruction --> We should not be incrementing the PC once again
It is already incremented in the preamble.

10) Figure 8.22: ldResult, mar, mdr, aluResult, regVal, regData, and regSrc can read
and write to the bus.

11) Page 646: #define N 1024; 
should be
#define N 1024

12) Figure B.4 (Page 644)
The 3 warps at the bottom should be
Warp 3, instruction 96
Warp 8, instruction 12
Warp 1, instruction 43

13) Figure 6.31.
In a DRAM array, the sense amplifier comes first, and then the column mux. Not the other way
round. 

14) Table 4.5 : The mul instruction in ARM does not support an immediate. 

15) In the chapter on ARM instructions, it is necessary to mention the existence of a .div and .mod
assembler directive, particularly for the exercises.

16) Section 6.2.3: A decoder and demultiplexer are not the same. A decoder sets one out
of 2^n inputs to 1. A demultiplexer is similar. However, it sets one out of 2^n inputs
to a given input value.

17) Figure 6.19 --> Should be J-K 

18) Flash memory: If the threshold voltage is equal to V_T+, then the transistor is in the
off state. It is erroneously written as "greater than".
