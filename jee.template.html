                                  <big>For many, IIT JEE preparation is
                                    a dream, for many it is a nightmare,
                                    and for many it is something that
                                    they rather never talk about. Given
                                    the mysterious aura surrounding the
                                    big J, I want to clear some of the
                                    doubts and misconceptions in public
                                    interest. However, before I delve
                                    into this topic, some words of
                                    caution and a disclaimer is due. </big><br>

                                      It is true that I have been a
                                      faculty member in IIT Delhi
                                      (jointly in Computer Science and
                                      Electrical Engineering) for the
                                      last 7 years. However, please note
                                      that I have nothing to do with the
                                      JEE process; I am not privy to the
                                      pattern of the question papers,
                                      neither do I have any interests
                                      whatsoever in coaching institutes
                                      and publishers, or any other
                                      commercial entity connected to
                                      JEE. I am also not claiming that
                                      by following the instructions in
                                      this blog the probability of
                                      qualifying in IIT JEE will
                                      increase. I am an academic with a
                                      Ph.D from the University of
                                      Illinois, USA, a background in
                                      industrial research labs (IBM
                                      Research and Synopsys), and a
                                      B.Tech in Computer Science from
                                      IIT Kharagpur. The reason I write
                                      this blog is because the recent
                                      events with regards to student
                                      suicides in Kota has deeply
                                      touched me, and my feeling is that
                                      if people are better aware of the
                                      nuances of preparing for a
                                      technical career, it might be
                                      beneficial. My employer, IIT
                                      Delhi, does not necessarily
                                      endorse these views, and I am
                                      writing in my personal capacity.
                                      Finally, the views in this blog
                                      are based on how the author
                                      prepared for IIT JEE, they should
                                      not be interpreted as a gold
                                      standard of JEE preparation.
                                      Different people prepare
                                      differently.</big><br>

                                    <big>Let me start out by saying that
                                      IIT JEE is not the end goal. It is
                                      only a means to an end. The end
                                      should be a satisfying career in
                                      science and engineering. Since
                                      IITs are one of the best
                                      institutes in our country, IIT JEE
                                      has special significance in this
                                      regard. As of 2018, around 1.2
                                      million aspirants write the JEE
                                      Mains exam, roughly 220,000 are
                                      selected for the JEE Advanced
                                      exam, and finally roughly 11,000
                                      candidates are selected. The
                                      success rate for a candidate in
                                      the JEE Advanced exam is roughly
                                      5%. However, note that it is not
                                      necessarily the toughest exam in
                                      the world. The Chinese Gao Kao has
                                      less than 1% acceptance rates, and
                                      so does the Korean CSAT. Of course
                                      comparison is tricky because we
                                      need to define what exactly
                                      a&nbsp; prestigious university
                                      means in these countries.
                                      Nevertheless, we can conclude that
                                      IIT JEE (also known as JEE
                                      Advanced as of today) is a
                                      difficult exam by all means. </big><br>
                                    <br>
                                    <big>In an examination driven system
                                      like India, parents and students
                                      often go to all extents to ensure
                                      success. This can include staying
                                      far away from home in small
                                      apartments and studying for 18
                                      hours a day. This brings with it
                                      psychological problems, lack of
                                      social interaction, and even a
                                      lack of holistic academic
                                      development. We are creating a new
                                      class of IIT JEE specialists who
                                      might not otherwise be very
                                      academically inclined. This is
                                      like making an athlete win a race
                                      using steroids. Once the race is
                                      over, the athlete is back to
                                      square one, and left with the
                                      dangerous after-effects of
                                      steroids. Unfortunately, in this
                                      case more than 95% of the athletes
                                      do not win the race, and this is
                                      even more dangerous. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      There is thus a need to opt for a
                                      more reasonable approach here.
                                      Before I share the details of how
                                      I prepared for JEE one more
                                      disclaimer is due. Please note
                                      that if one is interested in a
                                      technical career, then getting a
                                      sound academic background should
                                      be the aim. IITs are no doubt very
                                      good institutions; however, they
                                      are not the only good institutions
                                      in the country. Second, not all
                                      IIT students are super-smart, and
                                      not all students in other colleges
                                      are academically slow. Hence, if a
                                      student does not get a chance to
                                      study in IIT it is no big deal,
                                      the world does not end there. If
                                      someone is genuinely talented and
                                      hard working, life will raise them
                                      to wherever they would have been,
                                      had they gotten an IIT degree.
                                      Basically, focus on studies, be
                                      genuinely interested,&nbsp; and
                                      don't get depressed if you miss
                                      out on IITs. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      Let us now start. Unfortunately
                                      till a child is 12-13 years of
                                      age, the parents make the
                                      decisions. Gradually in the teen
                                      years, children take over. Let us
                                      look at classes 1 to 7 first. </big><br>
                                    <br>
                                    <big>In classes 1 to 7, parents have
                                      to take the lead role if they want
                                      their kid to be an IITian in the
                                      future. The most important thing
                                      is to find out whether he/she
                                      genuinely has the aptitude or not.
                                      Here, are some of the traits that
                                      children who are going to be
                                      future IITians possess at an early
                                      age: <br>
                                      <br>
                                      1. They are keen observers. They
                                      take a keen interest in things and
                                      are curious.<br>
                                      2. They often have good grades in
                                      their class, and are close to the
                                      top. <br>
                                      3. They are particularly good in
                                      Maths and Science. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      If a child is meeting all these
                                      three requirements, then there is
                                      definitely a possiblity. This
                                      needs to be nurtured. Parents can
                                      start exposing the child to a wide
                                      variety of scholastic
                                      environments. Here, are some of
                                      the things that parents can do: <br>
                                      <br>
                                      1. Encourage the child to question
                                      anything and everything. They will
                                      develop a scientific temper. No
                                      topic should be taboo. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      2. Encourage a regular reading
                                      habit. The child should develop
                                      very good English comprehension
                                      skills. This will help the child
                                      significantly later on. </big><br>
                                    <br>
                                    <big>3. Encourage participation in
                                      different kinds of small
                                      tournaments: spelling bees, chess
                                      &nbsp;&nbsp; tournaments, and kids
                                      olympiads. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      4. Put the children in contact
                                      with an adult who can ask them
                                      difficult logical and mathematical
                                      questions. Adults typically ask
                                      questions of the type: with one
                                      eye I see one cow, how many cows
                                      do I see with two eyes? In a
                                      field, we have crows and bulls.
                                      There are 6 heads and 20 legs. How
                                      many crows are there, and how many
                                      bulls are there? <br>
                                      <br>
                                      5. The general idea is to create
                                      an academic environment at home
                                      where everything from foreign
                                      affairs, to sports, to politics is
                                      discussed. Children need to take a
                                      keen interest, and they should be
                                      encouraged to speak up, and let
                                      their views known. Shyness in this
                                      case is definitely not a virtue.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      These activities will give kids a
                                      very light introduction to the
                                      world of competitive academics
                                      without introducing a lot of
                                      pressure. Even teaching how to
                                      handle stress is also a part of
                                      the training. The idea is to
                                      introduce stressful situations
                                      such as exams very gently and
                                      gradually. Parents need to trust
                                      their instincts or take
                                      professional help when there is a
                                      need. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      Class 7 is an important year. It
                                      is like an inflection point
                                      between regular schooling, and
                                      preparation for a higher career.
                                      At this stage, we need to
                                      understand some basic facts about
                                      our education system. School
                                      teachers are not JEE pass outs,
                                      and thus expecting them to train
                                      kids for JEE or something similar
                                      is not wise. Irrespective of the
                                      school, keeping such expectations
                                      is outright impractical. A school
                                      is meant for the masses, and thus
                                      it is incumbent on the parents to
                                      give their kids a little bit extra
                                      if they want more.&nbsp; <br>
                                      <br>
                                      In class 7, most students in our
                                      time used to solve problems from
                                      other books that are slightly
                                      harder (mostly mathematics).
                                      Nowadays, people can try books
                                      from other boards particularly the
                                      Singapore board, ICSE, or IB. This
                                      will give a slightly different
                                      exposure. </big><br>
                                    <br>
                                    <big>Let us now come to the three
                                      crucial years, where the main
                                      foundation is made. These are
                                      classes 8, 9, and 10. Let us look
                                      at what future cricket players,
                                      and Olympic athletes are doing at
                                      this age. They begin serious
                                      training. We are not talking of
                                      that rigorous training; however,
                                      the intensity has to gradually
                                      increase. At this age creating a
                                      strong and solid mathematical
                                      foundation is the key. For this,
                                      the school has to give the child
                                      enough time. Moreover, we also
                                      need time for physical exercise,
                                      rest, and social life. Parents
                                      thus need to choose the school
                                      wisely. Having a school that gives
                                      a lot of homework and assignments
                                      is very good, but at least in your
                                      author's view, is not the most
                                      ideal for this purpose. This is
                                      because a typical class has an
                                      overwhelming majority of students
                                      who are not training or aspiring
                                      to make a technical career in top
                                      institutes. Thus the level of
                                      assignments will be low. Given
                                      that our time is limited, it is
                                      necessary to use it more
                                      productively. Note that good
                                      sleep, good nutrition, and ample
                                      physical exercise are vital
                                      requirements throughout the school
                                      years.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      In classes 8-10, we can start out
                                      with one hour a day of problem
                                      solving. I would recommend the
                                      following books (note that I have
                                      followed these books myself, and I
                                      have no conflict of interests): <br>

                                    <big>It is necessary that the child
                                      meticulously solves all the
                                      problems (cover to cover) over a
                                      3-year period. In terms of mental
                                      stress, this is nothing. This is
                                      being done over and above the
                                      school curriculum. If a child is
                                      able to solve the problems in
                                      these books, then the school exams
                                      are a piece of cake -- it is like
                                      Virat Kohli playing blind-folded.
                                      Note that if the child is facing
                                      some difficulty a study group will
                                      definitely help. However, if there
                                      is a lot of difficulty, then there
                                      is no point in forcing the child.
                                      In the teen years, children should
                                      have a significant say in what
                                      they want to do. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      Let us move ahead assuming that
                                      the child is able to coast along
                                      easily. Starting from class 9, it
                                      is time to look at the Regional
                                      Mathematics Olympiad (RMO). There
                                      are many Olympiads today. However,
                                      the original RMO, and INMO (Indian
                                      National Maths Olympiad) are the
                                      ones that are of importance. Each
                                      RMO problem takes hours to solve.
                                      It is very important that early
                                      on, children develop the habit of
                                      just sitting, looking at the sky,
                                      and thinking. This is a vital
                                      skill that is required to do
                                      Science and Engineering. At this
                                      age, we want children to think as
                                      much as possible. Maths olympiads
                                      precisely give them this
                                      opportunity. Subsequently, if the
                                      child is able to do well in the
                                      olympiads it is great. Even
                                      otherwise, the experience is worth
                                      it. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      By the end of class 10, children
                                      who have been following these
                                      methods should have developed
                                      sophisticated thinking abilities.
                                      They should be far ahead of their
                                      peers, and also have advanced
                                      reading and comprehension skills.
                                      If this has not happened, and the
                                      class 10 board marks are low, then
                                      clearly we are not going in the
                                      right direction. It might be wise
                                      to change tracks.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      Let us now move to the crux years
                                      -- class 11 and 12 -- assuming
                                      that all is going well. Here
                                      again, we don't have to spend long
                                      18 hour days far away from home.
                                      Till now the approach has been to
                                      proceed slowly yet steadfastly. </big><br>
                                    <br>
                                    <big>In classes 11 and 12, the
                                      author strongly discourages
                                      gruelling coaching sessions far
                                      away from home. Again these are
                                      personal views, and are very
                                      strongly influenced by reports in
                                      the popular press regarding the
                                      prevailing situation. Stressful
                                      situations that can have a long
                                      term psychological impact are to
                                      be avoided at all costs. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      The aim is to develop a love for
                                      academics, and not treat JEE as
                                      simply a competition where one
                                      needs to win by hook or crook. The
                                      author himself has not taken a lot
                                      of coaching other than 4 hours a
                                      week with a great Maths teacher,
                                      Prof. Kiran Das (from
                                      Kharagpur).&nbsp; Students can
                                      attend coaching sessions. Most of
                                      these are also beneficial, as long
                                      as they don't test human limits.
                                      Parents need to ensure that kids
                                      are not getting unduly
                                      pressurised, and are not at a risk
                                      of developing mental or physical
                                      problems. Again whenever there is
                                      a doubt professional help should
                                      be taken.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      Here is my take on these years. In
                                      class 11, students have to solve
                                      very difficult problems.This will
                                      create the necessary background.
                                      They need to exercise their mental
                                      muscles as much as possible. This
                                      investment will continue to bear
                                      fruits even after 50 years.&nbsp;
                                      I would suggest the following
                                      books. Ideally, all the problems
                                      need to be solved -- not mentally,
                                      but by writing out the solution on
                                      a piece of paper. The author read
                                      from these books (again no
                                      conflict of interest).<br>
                                      <br>
                                      1. Problems in General Physics, I.
                                      E. Irodov (VERY IMPORTANT)<br>

                                    <br>
                                    <big>The author has unfortunately
                                      forgotten about the books that he
                                      used for inorganic and physical
                                      chemistry. The general rule of
                                      thumb for choosing a book is that
                                      it should be an international best
                                      seller -- a widely respected
                                      classical text.&nbsp; In specific,
                                      the author is a great fan of
                                      Russian books. Sadly, many great
                                      classics from Mir publishers are
                                      not available today. <br>
                                      <br>
                                      In addition, students can
                                      subscribe to test prep. services
                                      like what FITJEE, Apex, and
                                      Brilliant used to be in yester
                                      years.&nbsp; Most of these
                                      services have regular tests. This
                                      is a good idea because the
                                      students get an idea of their
                                      relative standing. These tests set
                                      the expectation and make things
                                      very predictable.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      Class 12 is the year when students
                                      need to gradually transition from
                                      fundamental building to exam
                                      preparation. Once the students
                                      have covered the syllabus, and
                                      have finished solving most of the
                                      problems from the aforementioned
                                      books, they can start writing mock
                                      exams with old question papers.
                                      Such simulated exams, will help
                                      reduce the stress that students
                                      shall feel in an actual exam hall.
                                      <br>
                                      <br>
                                      Finally, the big day arrives. The
                                      students hopefully will be well
                                      prepared academically and
                                      psychologically to take the exam.
                                      All the best !!!<br>

                                      Note that in this entire blog, I
                                      have tried to outline a method
                                      that is slow, gradual, and
                                      compassionate. Instead of a
                                      gruelling 2-year training package,
                                      an effort has been made to&nbsp;
                                      create layers of knowledge much
                                      before the student appears for the
                                      JEE exam. The entire focus is to
                                      build mental muscles slowly and
                                      gradually, avoid using academic
                                      steroids, and simultaneously
                                      preserve the love for
                                      academics.&nbsp; </big><br>
