                                    </b>Computer scientists have built a lot of AI-based tools to make their life easy. There are a lot of ML- and LLM-based tools for all kinds of tasks such as coding, web searching, HR management, etc. However, intelligent tools that tackle traditional engineering problems are not there. The Srishti group tries to bridge this divide by proposing smart AI, ML and LLM-based tools that use the latest advances in these technologies along with AR/VR to make engineering design a pleasurable and seamless experience.<br>

                                    Security is at the heart of every
                                    modern system as of today. It is not
                                    possible to envision an embedded, IoT or engineering system without built-in security. We work on enhancing
                                    the security of all kinds of complex
                                    systems in our group: software and hardware. <br>
