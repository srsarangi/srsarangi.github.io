                                  <big>I am writing an article after a
                                    long time. This time the topic is
                                    with regards to Indian startups. The
                                    reason that I am
                                    particularly&nbsp;writing about
                                    startups is because a very large
                                    number of students are opening their
                                    startups or are joining existing
                                    startups after graduation. The
                                    number of startups is growing at an
                                    exponential rate, and I believe that
                                    this will be a continuing trend. I
                                    want to give my take on this new
                                    socio-cultural trend. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let us first define a startup, and
                                    discuss why it is important to talk
                                    and write about it. A <b>startup</b>
                                    is typically construed to be a new
                                    venture in a hi-tech area. Again
                                    this might be a very restricted
                                    definition and clearly does not
                                    encompass new ventures in very
                                    traditional areas. However, let me
                                    stick to this definition in this
                                    article. Typically most startups are
                                    founded by students right after
                                    college or young professionals. The
                                    sad part of startups in India is
                                    that most founders typically
                                    sacrifice their career, earnings,
                                    personal life, and professional
                                    aspirations to create something that
                                    in an overwhelming majority of cases
                                    <b><font color="#ff0000">fails (for
                                        the statistics, read the last
                                        paragraph)</font></b>. My aim in
                                    this article is to highlight some of
                                    my thoughts on why I think most
                                    Indian startups fail, and look at
                                    possible solutions to this problem.
                                    Note that these are my personal
                                    views, and do not reflect the views
                                    of my employer, IIT Delhi.
                                    Additionally, whatever I am writing
                                    is from my personal experience that
                                    I have gathered from many of my
                                    friends, friend's friends,
                                    ex-students, and newspaper reports.
                                    Nevertheless, I feel that in the
                                    broader interest of society, I
                                    should summarize what I have learnt
                                    from people who have founded
                                    startups.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The first building block of a
                                    startup is the <b>idea</b>. Note
                                    that in this sense a startup is
                                    different from a traditional
                                    business. If I setup a shop that
                                    sells chocolates outside a school, I
                                    am guaranteed to make some money. I
                                    might not make enough money, or I
                                    might be chased away by the civic
                                    authorities, nevertheless, I can
                                    still find a way to stay above the
                                    poverty line. However, the idea of a
                                    startup is very different. It is a
                                    new business model, or a new product
                                    that needs to be sold to an upwardly
                                    mobile middle class. They might not
                                    like the idea, might not be
                                    enthusiastic about it, or there
                                    might be many other competitors with
                                    better offerings. Since most
                                    startups are internet based, the
                                    chances of competition are very very
                                    high because the internet nullifies
                                    geographical distances. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Clearly the <b>idea</b> has to be
                                    new, fresh, innovative, technically
                                    sound, free of legal issues,
                                    socially acceptable, and needs to
                                    have the potential to make a lot of
                                    money. There are many adjectives in
                                    the previous sentence, and we are
                                    assuming that the group of founders
                                    will have technical geeks, legal
                                    experts, business honchos, and
                                    sociologists. This is hardly the
                                    case. Most founders of startups in
                                    India are typically young
                                    professionals. Note that these
                                    people typically have good
                                    pedigrees, are confident,
                                    articulate, and have an appetite for
                                    taking risks. However, this is not
                                    sufficient. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let us wind the clock 10 years
                                    backward. Most students in India
                                    start losing touch of real life once
                                    they are 15-16 years old. The
                                    pressure of getting into a premier
                                    institution (IIT/NIT) is
                                    overwhelming. Students from small
                                    towns typically move to coaching
                                    hubs such as Kota in droves and
                                    spend the next 2-3 years preparing
                                    for different entrance exams. They
                                    have hardly any time for anything
                                    other than studies. Once they get
                                    admitted to a premier institution,
                                    the situation does not change
                                    significantly. Most of the time, the
                                    first year is typically the most
                                    strenuous in terms of studies
                                    primarily because students are new
                                    to the system, and a lot of them
                                    want to change their branch of
                                    study. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The subsequent years are no better
                                    in terms of developing a world view.
                                    Since most students stay in hostels
                                    and have limited access to
                                    television, they are mostly unaware
                                    of events of national and
                                    international importance. Since
                                    reading newspapers or anything for
                                    that matter seems to be out of
                                    fashion these days, students are
                                    bereft of the benefit of traditional
                                    channels of information that are
                                    otherwise available. Secondly, most
                                    campuses of premier universities are
                                    like ``virtual worlds'' -- fairly
                                    cut-off from the rest of the
                                    society. As a result, students do
                                    not develop a world view and do not
                                    develop an understanding of society.
                                    The situation does not grossly
                                    change in the first few years after
                                    joining a job. A typical job in a
                                    multi-national company in India
                                    involves very long hours and leaves
                                    little time for professionals to
                                    interact with the society at large.
                                    The weekends are often spent
                                    sleeping, partying or traveling. As
                                    a result most of the people that I
                                    have talked to in this bracket have
                                    a little understanding of the needs
                                    and requirements of a typical middle
                                    class family. They are mostly aware
                                    of the requirements of their friends
                                    but not of somebody who has young
                                    children and aged parents to take
                                    care of. Note that India has a very
                                    large middle class with a fair
                                    amount of spending power. Unless we
                                    understand their needs and
                                    aspirations, our products might not
                                    be what they are looking for. This
                                    dissonance in perceptions and actual
                                    requirements is a big reason for
                                    startups not getting enough

                                  <big>These are some random ideas, and
                                    I could come out with more. The only
                                    thing that I can guarantee you is
                                    that these will not work! Let us see
                                    what is the problem with the first 2
                                    ideas. Most people do not have a
                                    problem with having an extra remote
                                    (for TV or AC) around. Secondly,
                                    most smart phones have very low
                                    battery lives, and there is no
                                    reason to not be able to run the TV
                                    when the phone is discharged. What
                                    happens if the owner of a phone with
                                    this app goes out for a walk? For
                                    idea #3, there are hardly enough
                                    music lovers in an area to justify a
                                    startup. For idea #4, most middle
                                    class families will want to touch
                                    and feel a vegetable before buying
                                    it. They will not trust an online
                                    delivery guy. Idea #5 will bomb for
                                    sure because senior citizens are not
                                    very tech. savvy, and idea #6 will
                                    not work because already pharmacy
                                    stores do home delivery for large
                                    orders. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    As you see, all of these ideas might
                                    look okay, but are simply
                                    impractical because the society will
                                    not accept them for a variety of
                                    reasons. There can be many legal
                                    issues also. While making a
                                    matrimonial site, one needs to be
                                    very careful about revealing
                                    identities, and ensuring that no
                                    obscene content is exchanged.
                                    Otherwise, the legal consequence can
                                    be very severe. As you see, it is
                                    very hard to figure out so many
                                    things unless a person has the
                                    experience of actually living in a
                                    society and interacting with people
                                    across all age groups and social
                                    strata. Most founders of startups do
                                    not have this experience, nor do
                                    they try to conduct in-depth surveys
                                    to gauge customer perception; as a
                                    result the outcomes are not very
                                    favorable.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Lastly, I would also like to add
                                    that we have an enough number of
                                    startups that focus on online
                                    retailing, analytics, and social
                                    media. Why not have high technology
                                    startups that focus on the defense,
                                    aerospace, and high end
                                    manufacturing industries? Any
                                    startup that is based on technology
                                    rather than on an apparently
                                    ``good'' marketing idea has a far
                                    higher chance of success. Let us
                                    take a look at the math. If a social
                                    media startup earns 10 paisa per
                                    click (high in my opinion) it will
                                    take 10 million clicks to earn&nbsp;
                                    10 lakh (1 million) rupees per year.
                                    This is a very high number, and we
                                    clearly need to operate at a very
                                    large scale. In comparison, a well
                                    made piece of technical software or
                                    service can fetch upwards of 1 crore
                                    (10 million) rupees in a single
                                    deal. However, to produce such
                                    software it is necessary to be
                                    highly trained (at least a Ph.D),
                                    have loads of R&amp;D experience,
                                    and have very good contacts in the
                                    industry. We have a massive dearth
                                    of such people and this leads to
                                    extremely low tech. startups.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let us now come to the next
                                    important ingredient -- <b>money</b>.
                                    Money is an important ingredient for
                                    almost everything including a
                                    startup. Here again, Indian startups
                                    are very different from their
                                    western counterparts. This morning I
                                    was watching a documentary on TV.
                                    They showed statistics, which showed
                                    that an overwhelming number of
                                    western startups begin with funding
                                    from friends and family, whereas
                                    Indian startups get money from angel
                                    investors. Angel investors are
                                    venture capital companies that
                                    provide funding to early stage
                                    startups. There is a reason for this
                                    trend. In the west, there is a lot
                                    of competition among entrepreneurs
                                    to get their hands on venture
                                    capital money. As a result, venture
                                    capitalists are extremely cautious
                                    in disbursing funds. Consequently,
                                    most startups start in a garage with
                                    borrowed money, which often has to
                                    be returned irrespective of the
                                    final outcome. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    However, the situation in India is
                                    very different. Especially for
                                    students from premier institutes, a
                                    lot of funding is available. There
                                    are many kinds of angel investors in
                                    the market. There are some who
                                    genuinely believe in the ``India
                                    Story'', there are some who believe
                                    in the creative potential of our
                                    youngsters, and then there are some
                                    who want to use the VC route to
                                    bring in money parked in tax havens
                                    such as Mauritius and Singapore.
                                    Irrespective of the source of funds,
                                    angel investors are out there, and
                                    are willing to provide a lot of
                                    money. This is not necessarily a
                                    good trend. Taking money from
                                    friends and family puts a lot of
                                    pressure on young entrepreneurs to
                                    actually deliver, and return the
                                    money. In this case, relationships
                                    are at stake. However, taking money
                                    from a third party, which is pretty
                                    much coming with no strings
                                    attached, does not put any real
                                    pressure on entrepreneurs to
                                    deliver. Founders often leave
                                    startups midway, go abroad for
                                    higher studies, or simply get bored.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    To make Indian startups actually
                                    work, it is necessary to add more
                                    constraints to the money supply. An
                                    unbridled supply of money is not
                                    exactly the best way to go forward.
                                    Founders should know that the
                                    purpose of a business is to earn
                                    profit, and provide value to
                                    customers. Hoping that one day
                                    somebody will buy the startup for
                                    millions of dollars is not all that
                                    reasonable. It is true that some
                                    startups get sold for massive sums,
                                    and even some Indian startups are on
                                    that list. However, this is not the
                                    norm, and nobody should explicitly
                                    strive to be the exception.
                                    Additionally, startups from India
                                    have low visibility, and getting
                                    sold to Silicon Valley biggies is
                                    not as easy as American startups.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I would like to make another
                                    important point here. A lot of
                                    founders of businesses do not
                                    approach formal banking channels,
                                    and do not take advantage of
                                    government schemes. In this year's
                                    budget (2015-16) a thousand crores
                                    (200 million dollars) have been
                                    allocated to funding startups. It is
                                    true that to get government funding
                                    the proposal has to be above a
                                    certain bar because most of such
                                    proposals are reviewed by a team of
                                    experts often consisting of
                                    academics. This is a good thing, not
                                    a bad thing. Writing a good, well
                                    studied, and technically consistent
                                    business plan is not just desirable,
                                    it is also essential. If a group of
                                    founders think that they have a
                                    document that clearly elucidates
                                    their business idea, value to the
                                    society and the nation, then they
                                    should approach the government, and
                                    ask for help and guidance. Most
                                    students feel that the government is
                                    out of reach, and you need
                                    connections. Trust me, in this day
                                    and age, the government is far more
                                    honest and approachable, and
                                    ordinary citizens should at least
                                    make an effort to leverage
                                    government schemes to the fullest
                                    possible extent. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    We have talked about the idea, and
                                    money. What next? Well, it is <b>talent</b>,
                                    which is by far the most important
                                    factor once the founders have a
                                    decent idea, and have the financial
                                    resources. Who is going to do the
                                    work? Here, again Indian startups
                                    are very different. Let us look at
                                    Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Larry
                                    Ellison. These three distinguished
                                    gentlemen are the founders of
                                    Microsoft, Apple, and Oracle
                                    respectively. The commonality
                                    between all three of them is that
                                    they are all technical people, and
                                    spent a good part of their early
                                    life writing computer code, making
                                    circuits, testing and debugging
                                    their designs. The same is true for
                                    others such as Mark Zuckerberg,
                                    Sergey Brin, and Larry Page. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    However, this is not the typical
                                    profile of an Indian startup boss.
                                    Most of the time, the founders of
                                    Indian startups are business school
                                    graduates who might have worked in
                                    top finance/consulting companies, or
                                    are technical people without any
                                    interest in technical work. They are
                                    the ones that carry fancy titles
                                    such as a CEO, CTO, or COO, and
                                    there are others who often do the
                                    technical work. A lot of such CEO
                                    types that I have met were often
                                    very ignorant of the technical work
                                    happening in their organizations.
                                    This particular trend leads to a
                                    disconnect between the employer and
                                    the employee. The employee is
                                    typically not from an extremely
                                    privileged background yet spends
                                    60-70 hour weeks tirelessly writing
                                    computer code. The employer is the
                                    one who often looks at the
                                    sales/marketing aspects and often
                                    places unreasonable demands on the
                                    employee. There is no formula for
                                    kinship even in startups that have
                                    less than 10 or 20 members. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The important take home point here
                                    is as follows. In a 5 or 10 member
                                    startup we cannot afford a dedicated
                                    CEO or CTO. This places an
                                    unnecessary financial burden, and
                                    creates a disconnect between team
                                    members. Moreover, often CEOs and
                                    CTOs who are not technically
                                    inclined promise the world to the
                                    customer. They later on discover to
                                    their chagrin that their promises
                                    failed to hold water because they
                                    were extremely unrealistic. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let us now come to the employees. In
                                    today's market finding a good
                                    computer programmer is very hard.
                                    This might sound ironical given the
                                    number of top colleges that India
                                    has; however, this is true. Most of
                                    the students in top institutes are
                                    hired by very well paying
                                    multinational firms. It is very hard
                                    for a fledgling startup to match an
                                    MNC salary. As a result startups
                                    often have to go to other
                                    non-premier colleges to scout for
                                    talent. There is a big divide in
                                    India between different classes of
                                    institutes, and startups would often
                                    find otherwise sincere students that
                                    lack sufficient practical skills. It
                                    is not wise to invest a lot of money
                                    in training employees for an early
                                    stage startup. They need employees
                                    who are all set to begin coding, and
                                    thus being productive. This is
                                    seldom the case. It is even harder
                                    to find mid-level professionals who
                                    can lead teams. Their salaries are
                                    either obnoxiously high, or they
                                    have shifted to people management in
                                    their companies. In both cases, such
                                    people are not suitable for startups
                                    in their early stage. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Also note that in the Indian
                                    educational system, the emphasis on
                                    practical skills is somewhat low.
                                    This might be not very relevant in
                                    premier institutes where students
                                    have other avenues for exploring
                                    their creativity, but for the rest
                                    of the educational institutes this
                                    is a very important issue. It is
                                    paramount that we produce students
                                    who companies can hire immediately
                                    after graduation. Spending lakhs of
                                    rupees on training students to write
                                    even the simplest of programs or
                                    create the simplest of designs is
                                    not the job of companies. Only big
                                    companies like Infosys can afford
                                    it. Small startups cannot afford
                                    this luxury, nor should they be in
                                    the business of training. The
                                    responsibility of training engineers
                                    lies fair and square with schools
                                    and colleges. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    We are not just talking about
                                    technical skills here. A lot of the
                                    graduates in this country are
                                    severely deficient in liberal arts
                                    skills. Ideally speaking, we want an
                                    engineering student to write
                                    flawless English (or a vernacular
                                    language, if the need arises), be
                                    articulate, and be able to present
                                    to a technically literate audience.
                                    We will find very few graduated
                                    students with these qualities if we
                                    start looking. A lot of students
                                    pick up these traits later in life;
                                    however, a broad majority of them do
                                    not. This has resulted in a very low
                                    level of language proficiency in
                                    adults. Unless the Indian
                                    educational system starts putting a
                                    greater emphasis on humanities
                                    skills and focuses on all round
                                    personality development, we will
                                    never find people who can run modern
                                    internationally competitive
                                    businesses. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let us now look at a different class
                                    of people who are very competent,
                                    and want to join a startup.&nbsp;
                                    Such people might want to do
                                    something really innovative, or they
                                    might want to see what it feels like
                                    working for a small company. Some of
                                    my friends joined startups because
                                    they wanted to work in a company
                                    that sells products tagged with the
                                    line, ``Made in India.'' However,
                                    such examples are very rare. Let us
                                    see why. In the US, and other
                                    western nations, a company is a
                                    company. If anybody is employed then
                                    they are employed with a contract,
                                    which is legally enforceable. There
                                    are strict rules regarding payment,
                                    conduct, rights and
                                    responsibilities. The owners can go
                                    to jail if they violate terms of the
                                    contract. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In India, on paper we have a lot of
                                    laws, which are not bad at all. Some
                                    people argue that for companies with
                                    less than 20 employees, the laws are
                                    fairly lax. Well, I am not a legal
                                    expert, and thus I am not the most
                                    competent person to comment on such
                                    issues. However, the laws that I
                                    have seen on the face of it are not
                                    all that bad. The issue lies with
                                    the implementation. There is a wide
                                    spread belief among people that if
                                    they join a small company, hardly
                                    any rules and policies are followed.
                                    I do not want to lend credence to
                                    these rumors. However, I have heard
                                    a good number of anecdotal reports
                                    from friends and ex-colleagues who
                                    are complaining about irregular
                                    payments, obnoxiously long work
                                    hours, and improper standards for
                                    hiring-and-firing. Not all of these
                                    reports are false. My basic question
                                    is how many founders of startups
                                    have actually been penalized for not
                                    following proper procedures in
                                    running their companies? How active
                                    has our society been in pointing out
                                    such offenders, and how active have
                                    the authorities (including NGOs)
                                    been in ensuring that proper
                                    employment practices are followed?
                                    The answers are not very
                                    encouraging, and this particular
                                    public perception leads many
                                    technically competent people to
                                    avoid working in startup ventures. I
                                    would appeal to the government to
                                    ensure that irrespective of the size
                                    of the organization, all employment
                                    laws and procedures should be
                                    followed to the last letter. The
                                    message should be loud and clear:
                                    Laws are for everybody, no
                                    exceptions. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let me now summarize this article. I
                                    have talked about ideas, funding,
                                    and talent. I feel that we fall
                                    short on all of these counts, and
                                    thus our hi-tech ventures do not
                                    work. What is the evidence that I
                                    have? Please visit iSpirt's <a
                                      href="http://www.ispirt.in/Our-Industry/Industry-Evolution">website</a>,
                                    which is the umbrella body of Indian
                                    IT/ITES product companies. Here is
                                    what it says. Let us assume that a
                                    VC (investor) firm puts in 100 Rs.
                                    into startups. Let us see what
                                    happens after a couple of years. In
                                    Israel, the investor will get 700
                                    Rs, in the US he will 500 Rs, and in
                                    India he will get 110 Rs. The
                                    website says that even the figure of
                                    110 Rs is wrongly calculated because
                                    it includes service companies as
                                    well. Additionally, if we adjust the
                                    numbers for inflation, there is a
                                    net loss. From these statistics, we
                                    can clearly see my reason for
                                    writing this blog. There is a big
                                    difference in the success rate
                                    between an Israeli or American
                                    startup and an Indian startup. <br>
