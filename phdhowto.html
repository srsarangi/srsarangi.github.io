                                    <p><big>In our computer science
                                        department at IIT Delhi,
                                        typically 500 candidates apply
                                        for Ph.D admission. Based on
                                        some shortlisting criteria, we
                                        interview 100-200 candidates,
                                        and typically 5-10 candidates
                                        are ultimately selected. I
                                        believe that if there is a
                                        better flow of information, we
                                        can make the acceptance ratio
                                        slightly better, and students
                                        will have a clear idea about our
                                        expectations. <br>
                                      </big></p>
                                    <p><big>Before reading ahead, note
                                        that these are my personal

                                        benefit of the student
                                        community, and would urge the
                                        reader to use his sense of
                                        judgement while interpreting my
                                        thoughts. <br>
                                      </big></p>
                                    <p><big>Let us start out by
                                        considering the B.Tech, M.Tech,
                                        and Ph.D programs from the eyes
                                        of a common man. The common man
                                        perceives the B.Tech program as
                                        a program that imparts basic
                                        engineering skills, and he looks
                                        at the M.Tech program as a
                                        program that teaches a student
                                        advanced engineering skills, and
                                        also provides him some expertise
                                        in a certain area. An M.Tech in
                                        engineering is viewed as similar
                                        to an M.Phil in liberal arts, or
                                        an M.D in medicine. For example,
                                        a doctor with an M.D in surgery
                                        is expected to carry out complex
                                        operations. We trust our lives
                                        in the hands of such people.
                                        Clearly, the expectation is that
                                        once a student has finished his
                                        post-graduation he is fairly
                                        knowledgeable about his area,
                                        and has received advanced
                                        training in a particular
                                        discipline. <br>
                                      </big></p>
                                    <p><big>Now, a Ph.D is one step
                                        ahead. Once a person knows a lot
                                        about a certain area, he will
                                        also know about some of the
                                        limitations of existing methods,
                                        techniques, and theories. He and
                                        his Ph.D advisor will then have
                                        certain ideas to improve certain
                                        concepts/methods in his area. <u>Such
                                          ideas make a Ph.D</u>. A
                                        student will then take several
                                        years to refine and polish the
                                        basic idea to bring it to a
                                        shape in which it can be sent to
                                        a conference or journal for
                                        publication. Here again,
                                        reviewers might have a host of
                                        concerns and comments that need
                                        to be addressed. At the end of
                                        his Ph.D, a person is expected
                                        to know almost everything about
                                        the little tiny area that he has
                                        been working in, and to also be
                                        a very technically proficient
                                        person. Ph.D is also a license
                                        to teach, conduct research, and
                                        join academics. <br>
                                      </big></p>
                                    <p><big>Advanced degrees such as a
                                        Ph.D thus need to have very
                                        strict entry criteria such that
                                        we can ensure that the student
                                        meets the prerequisites. The
                                        prerequisite is that students
                                        must be very thorough in the
                                        basics of computer science, and
                                        should be able to answer
                                        questions of moderate difficulty
                                        fairly easily. If this is not
                                        happening, then the student is
                                        not eligible to join the Ph.D
                                        program. <br>

                                        Let me give examples of some
                                        questions. <br>
                                      </big></p>
                                    <p><big>1) I roll two dice. What is
                                        the probability that the sum of
                                        the numbers is equal to 7? <br>
                                        2) In C, how do function
                                        pointers work? <br>
                                        3) How can I sort an array
                                        in-place (without using extra
                                        space)? <br>
                                      </big></p>
                                    <p><big>We expect that students will
                                        be able to answer such questions
                                        with minimal amount of
                                        assistance during the interview.
                                        Students, who are not admitted
                                        to the program face a
                                        significant amount of difficulty
                                        while answering such questions;
                                        whereas, students who are
                                        admitted answer these questions
                                        satisfactorily. Our interview
                                        process typically has two
                                        rounds. In each round 3-4 main
                                        questions, and many more
                                        sub-questions are asked. A
                                        student gets many chances to
                                        answer questions, and most of
                                        the time the answers are not
                                        satisfactory (as the acceptance
                                        figures indicate). <br>
                                      </big></p>
                                    <p><big>Let us go into the reasons
                                        for this. I feel that we have
                                        not been able to communicate our
                                        requirements very clearly, as a
                                        result the student community is
                                        not getting the right
                                        information. We expect that all
                                        our candidates will come to the
                                        interview <b>prepared. </b>This
                                        is often not the case.
                                        Additionally, a lot of part-time
                                        candidates have the perception
                                        that their job experience
                                        substitutes for good interview
                                        performance. This is also not
                                        the case. In the age of RTI, we
                                        need to maintain transparency
                                        and fairness. After
                                        shortlisting, the only thing
                                        that counts is performance on
                                        the interview table. Discussing
                                        prior experience, professional
                                        contributions, and details of
                                        any prior research work, is
                                        pointless. All the candidates
                                        are on a level playing field,
                                        and they need to be able to
                                        answer the questions that are
                                        asked to them. This is the only
                                        thing that counts. <br>
                                      </big></p>
                                    <p><big>Let me now discuss the term,
                                        ``prepared''. It means different
                                        things to different people. Here
                                        is the way that I interpret it.
                                        If I were to prepare for a Ph.D
                                        interview, this is what I would
                                        do. I would pick up some of the
                                        recent books on probability,
                                        C/Java programming, algorithms,
                                        operating systems, and computer
                                        architecture from reputed
                                        publishers. Subsequently, I
                                        would read them thoroughly
                                        (cover to cover), and solve all
                                        the exercises given at the end
                                        of the chapters. I would also
                                        look at a basic engineering
                                        first year math textbook and
                                        brush up my mathematical
                                        fundamentals, especially
                                        regarding transcendental
                                        functions, trigonometry, and
                                        linear algebra. I don't think
                                        that any amount of slides and
                                        online courses will really help.
                                        They are valid supplementary
                                        material, but cannot be the
                                        primary means for imparting
                                        education. Additionally, it is
                                        necessary for a student to write
                                        long programs to really
                                        understand programming, and
                                        solve complex problems to
                                        actually understand subjects
                                        like algorithms and computer
                                        architecture. Merely reading
                                        articles on the web, and
                                        listening to lectures is not
                                        sufficient, and this clearly
                                        shows up in interviews. <br>
                                      </big></p>
                                    <p><big>What the interviewers are
                                        looking for is actually depth.
                                        Most questions start out to be
                                        simple. The follow-up questions
                                        are more complicated, and
                                        typically expose the weaknesses.
                                        For example, a question might be
                                        of the form, ``What is the time
                                        complexity of merge
                                        sort?''.&nbsp; Most students
                                        will answer, O(n log(n)).
                                        However, the follow up questions
                                        will be more difficult, ``Does
                                        the base of the log matter? What
                                        is a natural logarithm? How are
                                        log_2(x) and log_e(x)
                                        related?''. This is where
                                        students typically lose their
                                        way. The only way to be thorough
                                        is to read a lot, solve a lot of
                                        problems, and always try to go
                                        deep.<br>
                                      </big></p>
                                    <p><big>We often ask students about
                                        the number of lines of code that
                                        they have written just to get a
                                        sense of their background (not a
                                        part of the interview per se).
                                        Students who do not get selected
                                        typically reply: 100 lines, 300
                                        lines, 500 lines. This is not
                                        enough in my opinion. 500 lines
                                        of C or Java code do not achieve
                                        much. We should be looking at a
                                        minimum of a few thousand lines
                                        with a lot of object oriented
                                        constructs. Only then, can we
                                        say for sure that a student can
                                        write complicated programs. The
                                        same holds true for theoretical
                                        questions also. Before coming to
                                        the interview, a student should
                                        have answered hundreds of
                                        similar questions. They can be
                                        found in reputable textbooks,
                                        and over the web (see some
                                        popular job interview sites).
                                        These questions need to be
                                        solved in entirety. We often ask
                                        students to go to the board and
                                        write the answer. Thus, the
                                        student needs a lot of practice
                                        in writing precise answers that
                                        are easy to understand. In my
                                        opinion, nobody should come to
                                        an interview under-prepared. It
                                        does not serve any purpose.<br>
                                      </big></p>
                                    <p><big>There are some other aspects
                                        also regarding soft skills. It
                                        is necessary for the student to
                                        accurately understand what the
                                        interviewer is asking. This is
                                        not as easy as it sounds. Not
                                        understanding a question
                                        correctly is very frequent, and
                                        takes the candidate off course.
                                        After multiple clarifications,
                                        if the student is still not able
                                        to comprehend the question, the
                                        interviewer needs to give up.
                                        There are issues with the
                                        answers as well. Many a time the
                                        answers are not well structured,
                                        and because of poor English the
                                        meaning is not clear. Candidates
                                        need to work on this area. It is
                                        necessary to read as much as
                                        possible such that understanding
                                        a complex multi-part question is
                                        not difficult. I have found that
                                        students who read more textbooks
                                        tend to understand questions
                                        much better as compared to
                                        students who do not read them.
                                        It is also very important to
                                        read other written material such
                                        as novels, newspapers, and
                                        magazines such that language
                                        skills are high. This will also
                                        ensure that students can
                                        properly formulate their
                                        answers. <br>

                                    <p><big>Let us now come to the time
                                        and effort required in this
                                        process. Students from top
                                        institutes with good GPAs, or
                                        students with great GATE scores,
                                        are already prepared to a large
                                        extent. They typically don't
                                        spend a lot of time preparing.
                                        However, for students who do not
                                        know a certain subject very well
                                        for a variety of reasons, need
                                        to put in some solid effort such
                                        that they can come to the level
                                        of students that enter our Ph.D
                                        program. We are easily looking
                                        at several months of intense
                                        study for a student who is
                                        perceived to have a weak
                                        background. In my opinion other
                                        than a traditional way of
                                        preparing (read the book +
                                        answer the questions + revise),
                                        other methods have limited
                                        utility. It definitely does not
                                        make sense to try to memorize
                                        the answers to a large number of
                                        possible questions. The chances
                                        that a question out of that set
                                        will be asked in the interview
                                        is abysmally low. It is instead
                                        a better idea to harp on the
                                        basics. <br>
