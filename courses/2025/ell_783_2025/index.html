      <strong> <b><font  color="maroon">Evaluation Criteria </font></b> </strong>:&nbsp;Midterm (25% ), Major: 35%, Two
assignments (15% + 25%)<br>
      Passing criteria: 18% in theory and 12% in the assignments (both the criteria need to be met)<br>
  Audit criteria: 24% in theory and 16% in the assignments (again both the criteria need to be met)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For each&nbsp;assignment, there will be an easy and hard version. The latter will be based on the Linux kernel. The student<br>
        can choose to do either one.&nbsp;Note that assignments may be associated with a viva that will check the student's understanding;<br>
        if she does not do well in her viva, then she will get low marks regardless of the assignment that was submitted.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Assignments (easy&nbsp;track): They will be based on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public">xv6</a>. The first assignment will be a solo assignment and the rest two<br>
        will be done in groups of two.</li>
      <li>Assignments (hard&nbsp;track): All three will be solo assignments and will be graded quite seriously. They will have a bonus<br>
        component associated with them. They will give the student serious experience with the Linux kernel.</li>
      <li>If a student finishes all three assignments in the&nbsp;hard&nbsp;track, then she can carry the bonus marks (max: 12.5) to her course total.<br>
        However, the caveat is that the bonus marks cannot be used to pass the student if she is otherwise failing. The bonus<br>
        marks can  help increase her grade.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="maroon"> <b> General Policies </b> </font>  </p>
  <ol>
      <li>
      All deadlines are final. No deadline (under any  circumstance) will be extended. </li>
      <li>If any student is getting an E or I grade, he or she will  only be eligible to write the remajor. No other component will be<br>
        re-evaluated (or freshly evaluated).
        The class completely ends after the major exam.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If a student misses the midterm exam or an assignment  deadline, he/she is eligible for <br>
        a reminor or the third assignment. This  will be considerably harder than the midterm exam<br>
       or any of the assignments (resp.). No medical  certificate needs to be submitted. As a rule, no personal or medical matter<br>
       should be shared with the instructors or TAs. Also, any re-evaluation will be considerably harder than the original <br>
       evaluation. 
      </li>
      <li>Use the Piazza group for all communication.</li>
      <li>Zero-tolerance policy on plagiarism. If there is copying in any assignment, we will give you zero marks in that assignment and one more.</li>
      <li>If you miss the major exam, apply for an I grade. The  academic section will decide your eligibility.</li>
      <li>There will be no student-TA or student-instructor one-to-one discussion after the exam/HW scripts are shown. The student will<br>
        be given a chance to make a written submission, which will be considered while re-evaluating the script/HW. The written submission<br>
      will be read with a lot of attention, and after is read, a noting will be made.</li>
      <li>There should be no display of any kind of official rank, military rank, societal rank, JEE/GATE rank or any other such possession in the class, or in any other academic        setting related to the course. 
      All students will be addressed by their first name or any other name that they prefer, and all students will<br>
      be treated equally. No student will ever be asked to divulge any information that is not legally required for the seamless conduct of the course. It is<br>
      important that all students perceive that the playing field is &quot;level&quot;; the instructors will undertake all possible efforts to ensure that this is the case.</li>
      <li>Please only discuss academic matters with the instructors. All other matters including any adjustment or mental health related issues need to be discussed with your<br>
        faculty counsellors or student counsellors. The instructors or TAs are not qualified to deal with problems of a physiological or psychological nature.<br>
      </li>
